    "full_text": "I was     born   on  the sixth  of January,    1910,  in  the Platte\n    Valley   of  Nebraska,    just  south   of the  41st   parallel, just west  of the  98th  meridian,   just to the  north,  or south, or a bit to the  east of where   it sometimes    rained,  but  more than  likely  itdidn't,  less than  a mile   from  what   had  once been   the Lone    Tree  station   of the  Pony   Express    on  the\nOverland    Trail.\n   My   father   had  come   west   from   Ohio   to begin   a  new life with   the  Union   Pacific   Railroad   in  Chapman,      Nebraska.   My   mother   had   been  born   on the  bluffs  south  of the  Platte  in a  house   with  the  cupola   facing  the  view  to the  west.  They   met  in  the  barber  shop   of Eddie   Cahow, who   had  come   up  from  Texas   on  the  Chisholm    Trail,  but found   that  he preferred   barbering    to a  lifein  the saddle.\nThe   open  range   had  been  closed  by  strips of  barbed   wire, and  the  plow,  for both   better and   worse,  had   replaced   the six-shooter   and  the man   on  horseback,    a change   predicted when    the  town   called   Lone    Tree   at  its founding     was changed   to  Central   City  before  I was   born.  Early   settlers felt,and   with  reason,   that  a Lone   Tree   might   encourage maverick,    wandering     males,   but   discourage    most    marriageable   females.  My    childhood   impressions     were  not  of the  big  sky,  and   the  endless   vistas, but   of the   blaze  of light  where    the  trees  ended,    the  sheltered    grove   from where   I peered   at the wagons    of the  gypsies   camped    at its edge.\n  Six  days  after  my   birth  my  mother    died.  Having   stated this bald  fact,  I ponder   its meaning.    In  the  wings   of  my mind   I hear   voices, I  am  attentive   to the  presence    of invisible relations,  I see  the  ghosts  of  people   without   faces.\nAlmost   twenty   years   will pass   before  I  set knowing     eyes on my   mother's   people.   Her   father,  a farmer   and  preacher of the  Seventh-Day      Adventist   gospel,  shortly   after  her death   would   gather    up  his  family   and   move    to  a  new\nAdventist   settlement    near  Boise,   Idaho.   My    life begins, and  will  have  its ending,   in this  abiding   chronicle  of  real losses and   imaginary    gains.\n   My   father,   William    Henry     Morris,   born   on   a  farm near  Zanesville,   Ohio,  was   one  of fourteen   children,  all of whom     grew   to  maturity.    In  the  early   1890s,   with   his older  brother,  Harry,    he  came   west  to  the treeless  plains of Nebraska.     To  my   knowledge      no  one  ever  referred   to my   father  as  Bill. Both   friends  and   relations   called  him\nWill.  The   housekeeper,     Anna,    brought   up   from   Aurora to take   care  of  a  house,   a  widower,     and   a  motherless child,  pronounced     this  word    as  in  whippoorwilllll,     the sound   tailing  off like  the  bird's  song,   greatly  enhancing my  impression    of the  man   who   often  took  his  meals  with his hat  on.  He   was  a  busy  father;  the  bicycle   he rode   to and  from   his work    often  lay on   its side, the  front  wheel stillspinning.\n  On    weekends    in  Chapman       the  farmers   parked    their buggies  at  the hitch  bar  in  front of Cahow's     barber   shop.\nThis  provided    free  bleacher   seat  views,   for those   in the buggies,  of  the man   being   clipped   or shaved   in the  chair.\n\nIfthe  chair  was  pumped     up,  and  the  occupant   erect  rather than  horizontal,   he  was   able  to exchange    glances   with those  peering   over  the  half  curtain.   In  this manner,    according   to Eddie   Cahow,     my  father   first set eyes  on  my mother,   leaping   from   the  chair,  the  cloth  dangling   from his collar, to  help  her  down    from  the  buggy.   That   is the story, and   who   am  I to  change   it? She   was  the  youngest, and  most   favored,   of  the  four  Osborn     girls. Her    name was   Grace.   Her    sisters,  Winona,     Violet   and   Marion.\nGrace   Osborn    and   Will  Morris    were   soon  married,    and used  his  recently   acquired    railroad   pass  to  spend   their honeymoon     in  San   Francisco,   from   where    he  wired   the bank   to  send  him    another   fifty dollars.   A  son,  Fayette\nMitchell,   born   in  1904,   lived  for  only  a  few   days.  Six years  will  pass  before   I  am   born,  and   a  few  days   later\nGrace   Osborn   Morris    is dead,  having   given  her  lifethat  I might   live.\n   On  her  death  a  debate  arose  as to  who   should  raise  me, my   father  or  my   mother's    married    sister, Violet.  More than  sixty  years  later my   Aunt   Winona     wrote  me:\n\n   When    your   mother    died   my   sister  Violet   wanted    to take  you,   but  your   father  would    not  consent    to it. He said,  \"He   is all I  have  left of  Grace.\"    O  dear  boy,   you\n\n  were   the  center  of so  much    suffering,   so many    losses  you\n\n  will  never  realize,  know    or feel  .. .\n\n     This   decision  would    be  crucial  to the  child  who    played\n  no  part  in it. Much    of my   life would   be  spent   in an  effort\n\n  to  recover   the  losses  I  never   knew,   realized    or  felt, the\n  past  that  shaped    yet  continued    to  elude   me.  Had    Grace\n  Osborn    lived,  my   compass    would    have  been   set  on  a different  course,  and   my   sails full of  more   than  the  winds   of\n\n  fiction. Am    I to register   that  as a  child's  loss, or  a man's\n  gain?\n\n     The   small  creatures   of  this world,   and   not  a few  of  the\n  large  ones,   are  only  at  their  ease  under    something.     The\n  cat  crawls   under   the  culvert,   the  infant  under    the  table,\n  screened   off  by  the  cloth  that  hangs   like  a  curtain  . .. in\n  the Platte   Valley  of Nebraska,    street  culverts,  piano   boxes,\n  the  seats  of  wagons     and   buggies,    railroad   trestles,  low\n  bridges,   the  dark   caves  under   front   porches    were   all favored  places   of concealment.     With   Br'er   Fox  I  shared   the\n\n  instinct  to lie low.  Seated  in  dust  as fine as  talcum,   my   lap\n  and   hands   overlaid   with   a  pattern   of  shadows,    I peered\n  out  at the  world   through   the  holes  between    the  slats.*\n\n     In  a room   of  lampglow,    where    the  shadows    waver   on  a\n  low   ceiling,  I lie full  of longing    at the  side  of  a  woman\n  whose    bosom    heaves,   but  she   is faceless.   Would    this  be\n  my   father's  second    wife,  in a  marriage     soon  ended?    Not\n  knowing     the nature    of the  longing   I felt, would    it persist\n\nI and   reappear   as  a poignant    yearning    for  what   it is in the i past  that  eludes   me?\n\n     I  have   another   memory      of  lampglow     and   shadow.     A\n\n     *Earthly Delights,UnearthlyAdornments, 1978.\n figure  looms   above   me,   swaying    like  smoke,    and  against the  flickering   lamplight     I  see  her   fingers   unbraid    her hair.  I hear   the   lisp  of the   comb,   and   the   rasp   of the brush.  This   will  prove   to be  Anna,    a friend   of my   mother's sisters, who   has  been   hired  to  take  care  of me.   Heavily, her  arms   resting  on  the  bed,   she  kneels  to  pray.  Her hushed    whispering     voice  fills me   with   awe.   To   test the height   of the  wick's   flame   she  stretches   one   of  her  gray hairs  across  the  top of the  chimney.    Did   I see  itglow,   like the  filament   of a  light  bulb,   or is  that  something     I have    / imagined,    a  luminous    fiber  in  my   mind,   rather   than   the lamp?   My    child's soul  is enlarged    by  this nightly   ceremony  of  light  and   shadow,     and   the  voice   of prayer.    It is appropriate     to this   emotion    that  the   details  are   vague.\nLater,   gripping    her  hand    in the  church    pew,   I  feel  the throb  of  her  voice  before   I hear  it, and  share   her  passion with  fear  and   trembling.\n   One   reason   I see  itall so  clearly  is that  I have   so often put  it into writing.   Perhaps    it is the  writing   I remember, the  vibrant  image   I have   made    of the memory     impression.\nA  memory    for just  such   details  is thought   to be  characteristic of  the  writer,  but   the fiction   is already   at  work    in what    he  remembers.      No   deception    is  intended,    but  he wants    to  see  clearly    what   is  invariably,     intrinsically vague.   So he  imagines.   Image-making       is indivisibly   a part of remembering.*\n\n   In  this same    house,   in my   sleepers   with   the   \"feet,\"  I hurry   to stand   on  the   hot-air  floor  radiator    while   I am dressed.  In  the  kitchen   my  eyes   are below    the level  of the table  where   raw   sugar   cookies   are   being  rolled   for  bak-\n\n  *Earthly Delights,UnearthlyAdornments.\ning.  I  reach   and   clutch   some   of  the   dough:    I love   its sweet,  raw   taste.\n   In  the large   room   at the  front,  where    I lie with   pneumonia,   the  panels   of colored   glass  in the  window     make   a bright  pattern   on  the  bedclothes.    With   my   warm    breath, and  the   sleeve  of my   elbow,    I rub   a hole   in the  frosted window     and  peer   out.  The   world   is white.   I am   able  to see the  white   birches  in  the  yard  against   the  black,  twisted  buggy   lanes   in the  road.  Gifts   are  placed   on  the  bed.\nThe   flames  of  candles  glitter  on  the Christmas     tree tinsel.\nA  huge    bearlike   man,    with   a  booming     voice,  comes   in with  the  winter   trapped    in  his coat.  He   is Dr.   Brown.    I am   puzzled   why   the  fur  of  his coat  is on   the inside.   For reasons   that are  not  clear  he  comes   to see me   only  when    I am   sick.\n\nIf I attempt    to distinguish    between    fiction  and   memory, and  press   my  nose   to memory's     glass  to see  more   clearly, the  remembered      image   grows    more   illusive,  like  the  details in a  Pointillist  painting.   I recognize    it, more   than  I see it. This  recognition    isa fabric  of emotion    as immaterial  as  music.   In  this  defect  of  memory     do   we   have   the emergence    of imagination?     . .. Precisely   where   memory     is frail and  emotion    is strong,  imagination     takes fire. *\n\n   Mr.   and   Mrs.   Riddlemosher      live  in  the  house   on  the corner,   facing    the  railroad    tracks.   It  sits flat  on   the ground.   Spears   of grass   grow   between   the  loose  boards   on the  front  porch.   In  the  barrel  under   the  rain   spout  bugs skitter  on  the  water    and  polliwogs    cast  shadows     on  the\n\n   *EarthlyDelights,UnearthlyAdornments.\n slimy  bottom.   The   white   hairs  of  a mare's    tail, put  into the barrel,  will  turn  to garter  snakes.\n\n  I  sit on  the  side  porch   of  the  house   building    an  airplane   with   rubber    bands    and   matches.    Mrs.    Riddlemosher,   wearing    a  sunbonnet,    picks   gooseberries    in her garden.   The   tinfoil I collect  from   gum   and   candy   wrappers  I sell to Mr.   Riddlemosher      for seven   cents  a pound.\nIn the  summer     dusk,  from   the  dark  of  the  alley, I watch my  father  in  the porch   off the  kitchen   crumble   cornbread into a  tall glass,  pour   Carnation    milk   from   a can   on  it, and  squish   it up  and  down    with   the handle    of his  spoon before  he  eats it.\n\n   I see  my   father,   against   the  wind-rocked      streetlight, standing   in  his   underwear     at  the  open    front  window.\nBells   are  ringing,    whistles    are   blowing.     My    father scratches   himself   as he  listens.  Thinking     it must   be  the end  of the  world,   I wait  for it to end.\n\n   I am  given   a drum   for  Christmas,    and  I am   aware   as  I beat  itof  the power    that it gives  me  to  annoy   others.\n   At  school  I sit in a  circle of chairs  with   my  classmates.\nWhen    my   turn  comes   I go to the  blackboard    and  spell  out a word   that  is my   name.   I  write  this  word   on  a piece  of lined  paper   and  bring  it home\u2014a      gift of myself   to Anna, who   is full of  praise.  Although    largely   unobserved,    I instinctively  take  shelter beneath    a buggy,   a culvert,  a porch or a  table, from   where   I peer   out.\n   When    did  I thieve  and  strike  a box  of  kitchen  matches, sucking   the  charcoal   tips  for the  flavor  of the  sulphur?    I hear   the  abrasive   scratch   of the   match,   but  it  does  not light  up  the darkness    around   me.\n   Gerald   Cole   and  Dean   Cole   are my   friends.  Dean   Cole issmall   and   thin-faced,  like  a  witch,  but  Gerald    Cole  is big and  round-faced,    like a  pumpkin,    or  Happy    Hooligan without   a  can  on  his  head.  We   run   shrieking   across   the pasture  to  where   the  airplane  that  has  done   the  loop-theloops  limps  along   like a crippled   bird.\n  So   much    for my   impressions     of my    friends\u2014what      of theirs of  me?  Was    I a sniveler,  a  tattletale, a  crybaby?   A snot-nosed   little fart, or a  slack-jawed   snorfler?   In  all my childhood    no  mirror    or  window     returns   a  reflection   I remember.\n\n  Is  it a  fact  that  Gerald    Cole,  with   my   collaboration, dipped   my   head   into   a barrel   of  soft  roofing  tar,  then clipped  the  curls   from   my   head   with   his father's   sheep shears?   That   is  written   somewhere.     Is  it the  writing   I remember?     Sixty-five  years  later,  in a photograph     of children  gathered    in  the  open   for their  picture,   I recognize myself   as the  plump-faced     open-mouthed       child  with   the adenoids   in the  firstrow.   My   scalp  gleams   where   my   hair is parted.  On   my   right, surely,  is the  witch-faced,    apprehensive  Dean    Cole,  wetting   his  pants.  On   my   left,a bow in her  hair, the  girl who   hid  the  eggs  in our  yard   at Easter. Not  a  child  in this assembly    smiles   at the  birdie.  We are  sober,  worried,   expectant   and   fearful.  Such   incidents as  I remember     are   uniformly    free  of  the  impression,    if any,  I made   on  my   companions.     I am   a camera,   but  who itis that  clicks the  shutter   I do  not know.\n   The   long,   long   thoughts    of  childhood     approximate dreaming     in  the  way   they   hover   between     waking    and sleeping.   The   voice  the  child  attends   to  is the  one   that speaks   without   the  need   of an  answer\u2014the      voice  of  fire, of thunder,   of wind,   rain  and   silence.\n\n   If I  had  had   faculties  of  a  different  order\u2014what       my father  would   have  called  the  brains  I was   born  with\u2014the changing     pitch  of  the   mail   train's   whistle    as  it approached    from  the  west,   then  receded,   would    have  given my  dreaming     mind   something    to  ponder,   but  I preferred the  shimmering     fragment    of  suspended     time  that   I saw through   the porch   slats where    the train  had  just  been,  but was  no  more.\n   Neither   the  bitter cold  of winter,   nor  the  heat  of summer,  nor   rolling  balls   of  fire caused    by  lightning,   nor straw  driven   through   the  planks   of a  barn  left on  me   the indelible  impression     of  a  fuzzless   caterpillar,   green   as quicklime   and   spotted   with  bull's-eyes,   seen  in  the  fresh manure    in  the  dark   of  the  stable.  Nor   did  my    father's horse,  his tail sweeping    the  buckboard,    lead  me  to  marvel as I  did  at the  time   seen  on  my   new   dollar  watch.    The even  tenor   of  this time   was   occasionally    broken    by  the spring  Chautauqua,      in the  weeds   behind   the  water  tower, or the  Hagenbeck     and   Wallace   circus,  the train  pulled   on the  siding  beyond   the  cattle  loader   where   the  caged   animals   howled   at  the  edge  of  darkness.   Found    weeping    at the carnival,   where   I had  lost fifteen  cents  in the  sawdust, the  voice   that  comforted    me   said,   \"You're    Will's   boy, aren't  you?\"   And   so I proved   to be.\n   My   memory     of the  caterpillar   is still green  as  money, but  I see  nothing   whatsoever     of the  food  on  my   plate,  if my  feet  are shod  or  bare,  ifmy   face is freckled,  if my  nose is runny,   ifI  wear  knee-length    britches   or bulging   rompers, or  if the  glass  ball  on  the  doily  on  the  sewing    machine  snows   like  a winter   blizzard   when   it is shaken.\n\n   She  would   come   up  with  her  lamp,   the wick   swimming in  oil,and   cross  the room    like the figures   in  his dreams, without   taking   steps. Holding     the lamp    close to  his face, she  would   see  that he  was   asleep.  He  would   feel  the heat of the  lamp   on  his forehead,   catch   a whiff  of  the oil. She would   first open   the damper,    then   turn  with  the  lamp   so that  the  room   darkened    behind   her,  but  her  snow    white hair  seemed   to trap  the  light. During    the  day  it would   be piled  high   on  her  head,  but  when    she  came   up  with   the lamp   it would    be in  braids.   With  a  silver  handled   comb that  rattled  when    she  used   it, she  would    comb    out  the tangled   ends  of the braids.  Out   would   come,  like  the burrs in a  dog's tail, the  knotted  hairs.  When    all the  hairs stood up  straight,  like a brush,  she  would   pass  the  ends  over  the flame   in the  chimney,    where   they   would   curl  at the  tips and  crackle   with  a frying   sound.   The  smell   was  like  that when    she  singed   a  chicken    over  a  hole   in the   kitchen range,   turning    the  bird   slowly   in  the  flame    of a  cob dipped   in kerosene.  *\n\n   On   Hallowe'en,     big,  rough,   loud-mouthed      boys   came out  of  hiding   and  carted   privies  into  the  square    on  flat farm   wagons.   On   the  one  with  the  cushioned    seats I  read the  words   no   man's   land,   the  wickedness     of which    did not  escape  me.\n\n   I sang   and   whistled   \"Over    There\"    and   \"It's  a Long\nWay   to Tipperary\"     without    concern   as to  where   it was.\n   A  movie,   The   Beast   of Berlin,  was   shown    at  Donaldson's  theater,  to which   I gained   admission    by  distributing leaflets.  When    the  Kaiser    Devil  appeared     on  the  silver screen  we   pelted  him   with  tomatoes   and   rotten  eggs.\n   In  the  lot beside   the  tracks,  where    the  cow   was   pas-\n\n   *The Fieldof Vision,1956.\n\n    tured,   boxes   and  cartons   were   piled   as high   as  the  telephone    wires,  on  top   of which    a scarecrow     figure  with   a\n    funnel   hat  was  thrown    to be  burned.   In  this way   the  Kaiser  Devil   was    burned    in  effigy.  When     the  fire  cooled,\n    Gerald    Cole  and   I retrieved  the  blackened    funnel   and  returned   it to his  mother.\n\n       I was   cautioned    not to  bother   my  father   at his work    in\n    the  station,  or  risk being   killed  by  crossing  the  tracks.  In\n    the  long  summer     dusk,  if I looked   to the  east, I might    see\n    the  smoking    fires of  hoboes   behind   the  piles  of track  ties,\n    or  the   covered   wagons     of  the  gypsies    near   the  switch\n    tower,   their  hobbled   horses   munching     the  ditch  grass.  To\n    the  west,   if the  lights  were   on,  I would    see  my   father's\n    pale   face,  green   in the  shadow     cast  by  his  visor.  If the\n    window     stood  open   I  might   hear  the  cricket  chirp   of the\n    telegraph    key.  The   light would    glitter on  the  metal   strips\n\n    for  sealing  freight   cars, hanging    like  keys  from   a  loop  of\n    wire,  or  the  polished   knobs   of the  rubber   stamps   that  had\n\n    to be  stamped    to be  read.  If I waited   long  enough    I would\n\n    see  the  semaphore,     west  of  the  cattle loader,   switch  from\n    red  to  green.\n       The   summer     I  was  old  enough    to  roller skate,   a short\n\n    stretch   of concrete   paving   was   put  into  the street  just behind   the  depot.  What    shift in  continental   gravity   dictated\n    that  when    this  piece  of paving   was   extended    it would    go\n\n    to  the  east, not  to the  west?   I reflected   this same   shift  in\n     allegiance   in my   preference,    on  the  station  platform,    for\n     the  wide   diner   windows     of  the  eastbound     trains   when\n     they  stopped   for water.   From    the  platform   I observed    the\n     white-jacketed,    black-faced     porters   pour   water   into   the\n     gleaming    crystal  glasses.  I  exchanged     glances  with   smilL                                     13 ing  faces.  I cared   little about   where    these  people   were from,  but  I was  captivated   by  where   they   were  going.  On the map    on  the  wall  in  the station   lobby  all  of the  railroad  lines converged    on  Chicago,    the home    of Montgomery Ward    and   Sears  and   Roebuck.    It did  not  interest  me that  some   lines  continued    to other   places.   Chicago    was where   the trains  went   and  the roads   ended.  I do  not  recall hearing   my  father  speak   of a  place  called  New   York.\n  Once    it had   entered   town   from   the  east,  the  Lincoln\nHighway     made   a  dog-leg   turn  at  the  \"square,\"   an   open space  where   five streets  converged,   in order   that  the main street would    exit  parallel  to  the  Union    Pacific  Railroad as it followed   the  curve  of the  Platte  Valley.   This   confusion of  streets impinging     on  the square   left me   both  perplexed  and   enlarged.   I  was  living  not  in  one  town   only, but  two  towns,   each  of  which   had   its own   railroad.  The\nBurlington,   that  came   up  from   Aurora   one  day,  and   went down   to  it several   days   later, had   a  locomotive    with   a funnel-shaped     smokestack    and  a  cowcatcher    that  actually caught  cows.   On   the brick  station  platform   where    itcame to a stop  the  pistons   hissed  warm    steam   on  my   bare  feet and  legs.  Down    this  track  to the  south,  on   a rusty  spur, was  the  sandpit   rumored     to be  bottomless    with   sinks  of quicksand    at  its edges.   From    the  raft  on   its surface   I could  peer  into its depths,  or  gaze  at the  shimmering     foreshortened   image   of myself.   On  one  occasion,   with  Anna,   I had  traveled   to Aurora    with   butterflies  that  flew  in  and out  of the coach   windows.    Where    these  tracks  crossed   the\nUnion   Pacific  a  switch  tower   had  been   erected,  square   as a blockhouse,    with  the windows     at the  top so  wide  I could watch   the  man    in the  tower   seize  and   grapple   with   the switch  levers. If there  were   freight cars  on  the spur  to  the cattle loader  I might   climb  to the top  of the  cars to munch my   nut  Hershey,   or  chew   the  whips   of  licorice and   spit juice on  the  rails.I was   never  long  free\u2014once     I was  conscious  of  it\u2014of   my    impression    of  time  as  a  liquid   in which   all  things  were   suspended,    a  space   measured    by the flights  of sparrows   and   pigeons.\n   One   Sunday   I am   driven,  by  horse  and  buggy,   past  the cemetery    where   my   mother    lies buried.   A  man    with   a scythe  cut  the  grass  between    the  stones.  I was   saddened but  comforted   by  the  thought   that  my  mother,   in  heaven, had  her  eyes  on  me.\n   In a  room   flooded  with   light I  lieon  a  table  and  have my   adenoids   out.  Afterward,    to  quench   my   thirst, I  am given  bottles  of  grape   juice  and   put  in  the  rear  of  the buggy   where   I can  whoop    it up.  After  whooping     itup,  I can  drink  more   of it. Down    the  road  the  sun  smokes,   the sky  blazes  with  light  that spreads   on  the  plain, splashing on  objects.  It shames   me   to know    that  my  mother's    eyes are  on me,   my  own   burning   with   tears.\n\n   Through    the  vines   was  BickeVs    General    Store  and   a brown    dog  drinking    at the  fountain.   Sparrows    dropped from  the  trees to the  wires  and  then  from   the wires  to the ditch grass.  A pigeon   dropped   from   the belfry  to the roof of the  barn.  He  went   along  the  tin roof to the  hole, dropped inside.  Jewel's  Tea   Wagon    passed   and  the  dust  came   up and   went   by.  More    sparrows    dropped    from   the  wires, stirred   the  grass   near   the   road.  Mrs.    Riddlemosher stopped   picking   currants   and  turned   with  her  pan.  Mrs.\n Willard   came   and   stood  at the  screen.   Behind    the feed store Mr.   Cole's  mare  whinnied    and   Mr.  Bickel   smoothed his apron,   stopped   shooing   flies.  Tipping    her  sunbonnet back,  Mrs.  Riddlemosher      looked  toward   the  square   where the dust  came   marching    down    the road   with  the  rain*\n\n   Clearly,  from   a low   point  of elevation,   I see the  street, with  its  crisp  afternoon    shadows,    the  corner   where    the main   street  dog-legs   to the  left, the  barber   shop   and   its pole,  the  blazing    window     of  the   hardware     store,  the fringe-topped    buggy    held  up   at the  crossing   gates   until the eastbound    flier thunders   past.  Few   images,   after  more than  sixty  years,  are  more   indelible.  What    explains   it? I was  seated  in  Dr.  Brown's    office on  a  high  wire-handled potty, waiting   for  the final  verdict  in my   long  battle  with a tapeworm.\n  An   hour  or  so before,  on  Dr.  Brown's    orders,  I drank   a glass  of amber    liquid   guaranteed    to  finish  off  whatever ailed me.   It looked  and   tasted  like  tobacco  juice.  I would sit on  the   potty  until   the  verdict   was   rendered.    Time passes,   and   this  serene   tableau,   like  those   I  observed through   the   side  slats of  the  porch,   will  join  the  select views  that  grow   brighter   rather   than  dimmer.     The   train that  rumbles    past   does   so  in  silence.  A  cloud   of  dust sparkles  over  the  empty   crossing.  I hear  the  subdued    voice of Anna    as  she  speaks   to  Dr.  Brown,    as  if muttering    a prayer.  Unaccountably,      he  chuckles.   He   has  never   had  a tapeworm,    or  sat for hours  on  a  potty at  an open   window.\n   That   winter  we   had  a blizzard   that  leftthe  snow   drifted  as  high   as the  second-floor    windows,     darkening     the house.  I could  open   a window,    push   through   my   sled, and\n\n   *The Inhabitants,1946.\n glide through   the bushlike   trees of the  neighbor's   orchard.\nA  small  mound    of  dirty  snow,   hard  as  a  salt cake,  was stillin the  yard  in June.\n  One   night   I woke   to see the  flare of  lights in the  yard and  hear   the cough   of  a gasoline   motor.   An   automobile was  in the  yard,  the  motor   stillrunning,    because   my  father didn't  know   how   to  turn  itoff. He   had  bought   it in\nColumbus,    on  his way   back  from  Omaha,    and   driven  itto\nCentral   City  in second   gear  rather  than   shift. With   him he had   a young   woman,     dark  hair  framing   her  face,  her teeth  white  between    her  smiling   red  lips.  I could   smell her  perfume.   My    father  said,  \"Son-, come   and   kiss your new  mother!\"    and  I am  led  forward   to face  her. She  says,\n\"You're   not  going  to  kiss me?\"   Why    am   I so  reluctant?\nHer  hands   beckon   me  toward   her,  but  I am  bewildered.    I stand  my   ground    between   the  old  and   the  new   mother.\nHer   name   was  Gertrude,    and  with   her  arrival my   childhood  world   expands.",

    "full_text": "My new   mother    was   nearer  to  my   age  than   my   faMyther's,       and  we  got  along  fine. She  had   kid brothers like me,   with   whom    she   wrestled,   but  my   old  mother,\nAnna,   did not  like her  so  much.   In her  opinion   Gertrude was  old enough    to take care  of herself.  It was  agreeable   to me  to  have  two   mothers,   but   Anna   preferred    to live  in\nAurora,   with   her  own   people,   where    I could  come    and visit her  when    I wanted.    If my   father  was   too  busy   to drive me   down   in his new   car, I would   go  on the  Burlington local  with  the  butterflies  in the  coaches.  The   conductor knew    me,  and   would   see  that  Ingot  off  in the  right town.\n   In  1918   my   father   was   in  his  mid-thirties,   a jovial good-natured    man   with  wavy   brown    hair, his head   on the pedestal  of a  high  stiffcollar. He   liked to josh  people.  He was   friendly,  but  too  busy  for  friends.  His   sleeves were usually  rolled.  I see  him   crossing   the  tracks  on  a  trot. I see his  head   wag,   his  teeth-clenched    smile,  as  he  turns, hearing   his name   called.  His  name    is Will.  I like to  hear people  call him   Will.  Level  on  his  head  he  wore   a rolledbrim  Stetson   that he  might   forget  to take  off at  mealtime.\nAnna   would    say, \"Will,   your  hat,\"  and   he  would   take  it off.Gertrude    didn't  seem   to mind.   The  men   she  knew   not only  wore  hats,  they  smoked    cigars.\n\n   It was   my   father's  idea,  once   he  had   a new    wife,  to supply   the  Union   Pacific  dining   car  service  with  day-old\nLeghorn    eggs.  To  do  that  he would    firsthave   to raise the chickens   from  eggs   hatched   in  incubators.   To   do that  he would   need   a farm   with   nothing   on   itbut   thousands    of chickens.   The   man   in  charge   of the  Union    Pacific  commissary   in Omaha     felt that  my  father  was   the  man.   T  P.\nLuckett   liked  me,  and   I liked  him.   He   was   not the  first man   to rest  his  hand   on  my   head,  mussing    up   my   hair, but  he  is the  first that  I remember.     I  liked  that.  It was something    my  father   had  never  done.\n   T  P.  Luckett's  office  was  in  Omaha,    but  he  could   ride the railroad   free any   time  he  wanted   as  far as  Cheyenne,\nWyoming,     or  Ogden,    Utah.   The   eastbound    flier stopped in Central   City  just to let him   off. He  told my   father,  and my   father  told  Gertrude,    there  was   a  great  future   with the dining   car  service  in fresh  day-old   Leghorn    eggs.\n   Without    Anna   to feed  and  care  for  me,  we  had  most   of our  meals   in  local cafes.  On   weekends     my   father  would drive  us to Grand    Island,  where    we  would   eat  in a Japanese  restaurant   that  served  black  bread.   In a  glass case  at the  front of  the restaurant,    ifthe  proper   coin  was   inserted,  a  wax   hand   holding    a  bow   played   a  violin.  I  was given  the  coins   to insert.  Gerald    Cole   told  me  that  the music   was   made   by   a midget    violinist  concealed   in  the box.  I kept  this  information    to myself,  fearing   my   father would   no  longer  supply   me  with   coins  ifhe  knew   that.\n   In Central   City  we  had   our  meals  in  the cafe  on  Main\n\nStreet  with  tables  for  ladies. People   seated   in their  buggies parked   at the  front could  peer  over  the  half curtain  at the front  and  watch   us eat.  Some   of the older,  bigger  boys might   stop  and   make    faces. When     we   came   out  in  the street they  would   hoot  and   whistle.  This   amused    me  and\nGertrude,    but   angered    my   father.   I had   never   before heard   him   use  words   I  had   first heard   from   Gertrude.\nShe  had   learned   them   from   her  older   brothers   and   her father,  who    was   \"a   dirty-minded     old   bastard.\"   That didn't  mean   she  didn't  like him.   It wasn't   at all clear  to me  what   it was   she  meant.   On   the  side  of a  freight  car near  the  station  I saw  the  name    morris   printed   under   a drawing   that  I  knew   to be  dirty  but  did  not  know    why.\nThe  shame    I felt kept  me  from   talking  about   it.\n  Was    it perhaps   the  local  gossip  that  led  my   father  to move   us first to Kearney    and   then  to Schuyler?    My    new mother   and   his  pretty  wife,  accustomed     to life in  a  big city, sat all day  in  a rented   house   with  the  green   shades drawn    against   the   heat   and   light.  She   had    no  lady friends. There   were   no  radios.  All she  had  was  me   to talk to, and  to fight  with  over  the  flavors  in the  box  of Whitman   chocolates.  I  wound    the Victrola   for her  and   played her  favorite record,   \"When     You  Wore    a Tulip,   a  Bright\nYellow   Tulip,  and  I Wore    a Red,   Red  Rose.\"   I had  some boys  to play  with,  in the willows    along  the river,  until we allwent   to eat and  then  to a  movie.  Gertrude    liked  mushy movies.  I liked  William    S. Hart,  Tom    Mix,   Hoot   Gibson and   Harry    Carey.    We    both   liked   Charlie    Chaplin.\n\nWatching     Charlie   Chaplin,    I  got  the  hiccups   so  bad   I often had   to leave my   seat and   go for a  drink  in the  lobby.\n  On    the  Fourth    of  July   we  were    living  in  Schuyler, where   I  spent  all  day  in  a  piano   box   with  three   other boys  smoking    firecracker   punk   and  corn   silk rolled  up  in toilet paper.  One   or  the  other  made    me  so  sick I just  lay there  in the  box  until  my  father  found   me.\n  On   a  cold, sunless   day  I walked   with   my   classmates   to where   a railroad   coach   had  been   parked   on  a  siding.  Inside the  coach  it was   dark,  but  the  shining  steel  blades  of swords   and   bayonets   reflected   the  dim   light. The    coach was  full  of war   gear   and  weapons     taken   from   the  \"enemy\"   on  the western   front.  I had  heard   about  the  western front, but  I did  not know    where   it was.  There   were   shells and  shell casings,  helmets   with   spears  on  the  top, helmets shaped   like buckets,   leather  puttees   and   belts, a pistol  in a holster,  a uniform    with   a bullet  hole  through    the chest pocket.  Some   of  us saw   itand   giggled.  In  a war   with  BB guns,  my   eye  at a  knothole   in a  privy,  I was   hit just  below  the eyeball   by a  BB  that  just stuck  there.  When    it fell out it left a big  freckle.  I had  been   warned    not to  shoot  a gun  at anybody.    I left the coach   before  the  others  and  ran back  to  the  station  to get  away    from  the  smells   and   the unwelcome     impressions.     The    station  lobby   was    warm, there  was  a  scale near   the door,   and  as  I weighed    myself without   a  penny   I  heard   the  chirp  of  the  telegraph   key through   the  grill at the  ticket window.\n   In Kearney    and   Schuyler   my   father  firstspoke   to us  as\n\"you  two.\"   \"What    have   you  two  been   up  to?\"  or  \"What would   you  two  like  to do?\"  We   were   usually   of one  opinion. We   wanted    to eat, then   go to  a movie.   We   had  similar tastes   in ice  cream    and   sundaes,   but   I liked  Black\n\n                                                                  \u2014\n\nJack  gum   better  than  Juicy   Fruit  or  Spearmint.    We  both liked  popcorn    better  than  Cracker    Jacks.   When    I  came home   from   school  we   might   play  checkers   or  caroms,   or she  would   dress  me  up  in  her clothes  and   we  would   have a party.  In  the mirror,   standing   on  the  bed, I saw   myself wearing   her  shoes  and   hats.  If we  wrestled   and  I  started to win,  she  would   tickle me   or bite.\n\n   If we   met  other   people,   my   father  referred   to  us  as\n\"they\"   or  \"them.\"    \"They    don't  like  that\";  or  \"I've  got them   to consider.\"   In arguments     we  took  the same   side itwas   us  against  him.   I often  felt sorry  for Anna    but  in league   with    Gertrude,     whose    tastes   and   opinions    I shared.  She   especially  hated   Schuyler.   She   made   my   father drive  us  clear to  Columbus     to eat.\n   Late  in the  fall he  drove   us back   to Central   City   to a farm  he  had  bought   a  mile  north  of town.   The  house   had been  repainted,   had   a pump    in  the  kitchen,  and  mice   in the walls   we  could  hear   scrambling    at night.  Behind    the house   were   the new    sheds  with   incubators    to hatch   the eggs  that would   soon   be Leghorn     chickens.\n   Because   we  were   living  out  of town   and   had  no  place to eat, my  father  was  able  to persuade    Anna   to come   from\nAurora   and   take  care  of  us.  We   lived  in the  front  bedroom  upstairs,   with  a pipe  that  came   up  from  the  stove in the kitchen,  and   if I turned  down    the damper    it filled the rest of the  house   with   smoke.   If we   didn't  turn  it down we  almost   froze.  My   father   lived  downstairs,   in  a room off the  yard,  where   he  could  keep   an  eye  on  the incubators that  had   to run   all night.  The   farm   had   ten  acres, planted   with  beans   for  the  war   effort,  when   my   father bought   it.On   the east, high  on  an  embankment,     the  Burlington  local  went  north   on one   day, and   came  back   south on the  next.  We   knew   when    itwas   coming   back   because italways   whistled   approaching    Central   City.\n   More    could   happen    to  a  chicken,   my   father   found, than  could   happen    to an  egg.  While   they  were   still pullets, too young    to lay eggs,  some   of  them   acted  strangely and  took  sick. They    huddled   off by  themselves,   their  eyes lidded.  In  a few  days  most   of them   were   dead.  They    began  to die so  fast my  father  had  to hire  help  to bury  them.\nA  big  pit was  dug   in the  yard,  the  dead  chickens   thrown in, then  covered   with  quicklime.   The   smell  was  so bad  we kept   the  windows     closed  and   the  shades   drawn    at  the back  of  the house.   Before  the  last pullets  died,  my   father put  them   into  crates  and  sent  them   to his brother   Harry in Norfolk,   who   leftthem   uncalled   for on  the station  platform   out of  fear of infecting  his  Plymouth    Rocks.\n   The   chickens   that  didn't  die  wandered     around   in  the bean   field until  it snowed,    and   we  could   no  longer   see them.   My   father's  clothes   were  so  filthy and   he  smelled so bad,  Anna    brought   us our   food to  our  room,  where   we had   an   oil-burning    heater    to  warm    us.  We    huddled around    itplaying   caroms,   which   was   the  one  game   Gertrude   was   good   at. On    the  weekends     people   who   had heard   about  the  chickens   would   drive  out in their  buggies to see  what  was   happening.    Itpleased   my  father  that  they couldn't   see the  Leghorns    after it snowed.    If they  parked their  buggies   near  the house   Gertrude    would   stand  at the window,     thumbing     her  nose   at them.    I'd never   seen  a woman     do  that.  To  see  it thrilled  and  pleased   me   more than   itshamed    me.\n\n   In  the second   week   the bigger   pullets  were  dead   before he  picked    them   up.  It  was   not  necessary    to  cut  their throats  or  wring    their  necks.   They   were   stiff, yet  they seemed   very  light when    he scooped   them   up  on the  shovel, as if dying  had   taken  a load  off of them.   During   the  third week   three  experts  arrived,  at  his expense,  from    Chicago, and  took  most  of one  day   to tellhim   there  was  nothing    to be done.   Then   they  went  off, after carefully  washing    their hands.\n   Sometimes     he  stopped   long  enough    to  look  out at  the road,  and  the  rows   of buggies,  where    the women     and  the kids  sat breathing   through    their handkerchiefs.     That  was something    they  had  picked   up  during   the  war.  When    the flu  came    along,   everyone     had   run   around    trying    to breathe   through   a handkerchief.    In  spite of the  smell  they all liked  to  sit where   they   could  keep   their  eyes  on  the house,  and  the  upstairs  room   where   the  boy  and  girl were in  quarantine.   He   had  more   or  less ordered   them   to stay inside.  Now   and   then  he  caught   sight of the  boy  with  his head   at the  window,   peering    at him,  and   one  evening   he thought   he heard,   blown   to him,  the  music  of their phonograph.   Something    about   a  lover who   went   away    and  did not  come   back.\n   Nothing    that  he  did, or  paid   to have   done,  seemed    to help.  The   hens  he  shipped   off to  Harry   died  on  the  railroad  platform.   They   were   left in their  crates and   shipped back   to him   for burial.  He   was   advised   to keep   his sick chickens   to himself.\n   And   then  itstopped\u2014for     no  more   apparent   reason   than it had   begun.   It left him   with  one  hundred    and   twentyseven  pullets  stillalive. He   sat around   waitingfor    them   to die,  but  somehow     they   went   on  living,  they  even   grew fatter, and   early  every  morning     the  three  young   roosters crowed.  It was   something    like thefirst, and   the last, sound that he   had  ever   heard.   When    he  heard   them    crow   he would   come   to the  window,   facing   the  cold  morning    sky, and  look  at  the  trees  he  had  planted   at  the  edge   of the yard.  They   were  wired   to the ground,   which   kept  them,   it was  said, from   blowing   away.  *\n\n   In April   we  opened    the windows     and   let the fresh   air into the  house.   The   stink  of  the quicklime    was   gone.  In the  corners   of  the  bean   field, packed    around    the  fence posts,  you   could   still see  the  bodies   of  some   chickens, white  as  snow.\n   Coming    back   from   town,   where    we   had  gone   to  eat, and  had   put  Anna    on  the  train  for Aurora,    the  way  the sun  blazed   on  the upstairs   windows     the  house  looked   on fire.\n\n   \"It looks  on  fire!\" I said.\n   Gertrude    said, \"I  wish  to Christ   it was!\"\n   We   were  stillin  the car, parked    beside  the house,   when my  father  asked   us, \"Where     would   you  two   like to live?\"\n   We   both  said Omaha.     We   had  often  talked  it over,  and that  was  it.\n   On   our  way   to Omaha     a  few  days   later, the  fields on both  sides  of the  road  were   green   as grass.  \"Look    at  the grass!\"  Gertrude    cried.\n\n   \"It's not  grass,\"  my   father  said, \"it's winter   wheat.\"\n\n   I didn't  know   what   it was,  but  when   Gertrude    laughed to learn  it was  winter   wheat,   I laughed   along  with   her. It was   us against   him.\n\n   *The Works ofLove, 1952..",

    "full_text": "Until   my   father  found   a  house   for us,  we  lived  in  a\n\\J   hotel  near   18th  and   Farnam.    From   the  fourth-floor window,    my   legs held   by  Gertrude,    I peered   to  see the buglike  people   in  the  street.  During    the  day,  while  my father  was  at his  business,  Gertrude    and  I sat  in the  lobby.  Between    the  plants  growing     in wooden     tubs  at the front there   were  oak   rockers  facing  the  window.    All  day long  streetcars  passed   and  automobiles    I didn't  know    the names    of. My    father's   car,  a  Willys    Knight    touring, might   be  parked   at  the  curb.  I was   free  to walk   to  the corner  in either  direction,  or  sit in the car  and   watch  the people   passing.   In  April   all the   kids  my   age   were   in school,  and  I saw  only  grownups.\n   Most   people  thought   Gertrude    was  my   sister.The   man who   worked   at the  desk  would   ask  me,  \"And   how   is your sister?\"  and  I would    say  fine. Behind   the  desk   were  rows of pigeonholes    for  keys   and^  mail,  and   to the  left  of the desk  was  the  cigar  case. A  pad  of  green  cloth  sat on  top  of the case,  along   with  a  leather  cup   for rolling  dice.  If you rolled  the  dice  and  won,   the  glass   top  of the  case   could slide back   so you  could   help  yourself   to one  of the  cigars.\n\nIf you   didn't   roll the  dice   the  girl  behind    the  counter would   reach  for  the  cigar  herself  and  hand   it to you.\n  What     I liked  was   the  sound   of the  dice  in  the  leather cup.  It puzzled    me   why   Gertrude    had   given   up  playing and  rolling  the dice  to marry    my  father,  who   did  not  even smoke.   If I  was  on   the  fourth  floor  and   leaned   over  the stair rail, or  listened   at the  gate  to  the  elevator,  I  could hear  the  dice  rattle  in the  cup  and   the  sound   they   made spilling  out on  the  pad.  I  liked the  tile floor  of the  lobby, the swinging    doors,   and  the  men's   room   I could   go  to all by  myself,   now    that  I  had   pants   that  buttoned     at the front. When     my   father  found   a  house   we  were   both   disappointed:   we   didn't  want   to leave.\n   The   house  was   near  a big  park   at the end   of the  streetcar  line, the   night  sky   lighting   up  when    the  conductor reversed  the  trolley.  I had  a  bedroom    to  myself,  and   with the  window      open   I  could   hear    the  slam-bang      as  he walked   through    the  car  turning   back   the  seats. I  walked through   the  park  to  get to the  school,  but  I played   hookey most   of the  time   to hunt   for  lost golf  balls.  Five  days   a week   the  park  was   empty,   and   I wondered     why   they   cut the grass   the way   they  did  in parts  of it, but  on  weekends there   were   clumps    of  men    wearing    knickers,    carrying their  bags   of  clubs.  I watched     them   tee  off.  I watched them   look  for the  balls in  the uncut   grass.  The   balls were easy  to find  if I took  off my   shoes  and   walked    around   in the tall grass  barefoot.   If the  balls were   not  dented   I sold them   back  to the  players.  With    this money    I bought   pop, candy   and   marbles,    which    I told  Gertrude     I  had  won playing   \"keeps.\"   Gertrude's    family   lived  in  Omaha,     but they  were   not  people   she  liked  to visit. Her   older  sister,\nEvelyn,   worked   at  the cigar  counter   at  the  Paxton   Hotel, on  14th  Street,  and  went   to movie   matinees    with  me   and\nGertrude    on   Saturday    afternoons.    After   the   movie   we might   go to a  drugstore   for  a cherry   Coke.\n   My   father's   place  of  business,   on  11th   Street,  was   a low  dilapidated   frame   building   with  an  office at the  front.\nIn the  large  room   at  the  back  he  fed  and  fattened   chickens, killed  and   plucked    them,   and   candled   eggs.  Empty egg  cases  filled with  flats and   fillerswere   piled  along   the walls.  The   plank    floor  of  the  room    was   smeared    with chicken   blood,  feathers   and   the  laying   mash    he  fed  the chickens.  My    father  killed chickens   by  clamping    the birds between   his  knees,  slicing  their  necks  with   the blade   of a razor,  snapping     their  necks,   then   tossing  them    to  flap their wings    and   bleed  in  the  center  of  the  room.   Sometimes  they  got  up  and  walked    around,   like they  were   tipsy, and   had  to  be  cut  again.   When    they   were   bled,  my father  dipped   them   into  a boiler  of steaming    water,  hung them  on  a hook,   plucked   off their  feathers.  My   father  was so good  at  ithe  could   pluck  two   or three  chickens   a  minute if he  didn't  stop  for the  pin  feathers.  It took  me  three or four  minutes   a  chicken,  and   the smell  of  the wet  feathers didn't  help  any.  I preferred   to  candle  eggs.\n   My   father's   candling    room   was   like  a  dark,   narrow pantry,   the only   light  coming   from   the  two   holes  in  the candler,  a  Karo   syrup  pail  with  a  light bulb   in it. If eggs were  held  to the  holes  and  given  a  twist, you  could   see the orange   yolks  twirl  and   the  dark   or  light  spots  on  them.\nYou  could  also  see the  shrinkage    at the end   of the egg  and tellif it was   fresh  or out  of  cold storage.   The   creameries that  sent  my   father  their   eggs  always   tried  to  mix   cold storage   eggs  in  with   the  fresh  ones,   and   that  was   why they  had  to be  sorted.  I got so I could   tella  really  bad  egg by just  picking   itup.\n   My   father  could  candle   six eggs  at a time,  three  in each hand,   and  sort  them   into  three  grades   of size  and   freshness. He   could   candle   two  cases   of eggs  while   I  candled one.  On   Saturday    mornings,    when    I came   along   to  help him,  he   would    pay  me   ten  cents   a  case  for  the  eggs   I candled,  and   five cents  for each   plucked   chicken.\n\n   I hated   picking   chickens,    but  I  liked  to  be  with   my father  in the  candling   room.   He  worked    with   his coat  off, his Stetson   hat   on,  his  sleeves  turned   back   on  his  forearms,   a sliver  from   one  of  the  egg  cases  wagging     at the corner   of  his mouth.    While    he   candled   eggs   he  would whistle  or hum    snatches   of tunes.  Right   after breakfast   he might   talk to  me  about   his  plans  to make    a deal  with   all the state's  creameries   to  send  him   their  eggs. He   planned to expand,    with  a  store  in  Fremont,    and   maybe    another one  in Columbus.     He   planned    to get  his own   truck   so he wouldn't   have   to use  the  back   seat  of the  Willys   Knight for deliveries.  If he  got  worked    up  he  would   pause   in his candling   to  chip  the   dung   off  one  of  the  eggs  with   his thumbnail.    To   candle   eggs   you   lean  your   front  against one  of  the  cases  and   get  excelsior  and   splinters   in your vest and   pants  front.  My   father  bought   a  pair of  coveralls to  avoid  this,  but   they  were    hard   to  pull  on   over  his pants,  and   even  harder   to pull  off. They   were   also  hot  to wear   in muggy     summer    weather.    What    we  both   disliked about   candling   was   having   to break   the  cracked    and  the not-so-good    eggs  into  a  big  tin pail  we   sold  to the  bakeries. Some   of  these  eggs  were   so rotten  I had   to hold  my breath   while   I fished  them   out  of  the  pail. A   really  bad egg  gives off  heat, which    you  can  feel in your   fingers,  and might   explode   in your  hand   if you  aren't  careful  with  it. I buried   these  eggs  in a hole   I dug  at the  rear  of the  shop.\n\n   I was   so reluctant   to work    for my   father   I might   pretend  to be  sick. One   reason   was   I would    rather  not  work at all on  Saturdays,    when    baseball  games    were   played   in the park,   and  the other   reason  was   that his  contracts  were not  binding.    Having    promised    me   ten   cents  a  case,  he wouldn't    happen    to  have  the  change    in  his  pocket,   and would   owe   it to me.   It soon  got  so  he  owed   me   so much neither  of  us liked  to bring   it up.\n   In the  candling   room,   smelling   of cracked   eggs   and  excelsior, the  scorched    smell   given  off  by  the  candler,   my father  was    a  ponderable     presence,   more    than   a  voice, more   than   a  father.  The   light  flashed   on,  then   off, his face. I heard   the  eggs  drop   into the  fillers. In  the intense beams   of  light from   the  candler   the  air was   thick  as water. Many     things   swam     in  it. Inside   the  egg  the   yolk twirled,  there  was  an  eye  like a hatpin,   there  was  a  lumpish cloud  soon   to be a  chicken,   there  was  a visible  shrinkage, indicating    age, all  revealed   in the  light  beam.   I was not  well  paid,   but  I  was   well  schooled,   and   would    not soon  forget  what   I had   learned.\n   Saturday    afternoons,    given   my   freedom,    I  would    go over to  Douglas   Street  and  make    my  way   from  pawnshop to pawnshop,      appraising    and   comparing      the  watches.\nThe   choice  was  wide.   Silver watches,   wound     with  a key, so large  they   would   not  squeeze    into  my   watch   pocket.\nGold   watches   with   engraved   cases,  the  lid flipping   open when   the  stem   was   pressed.  Watches    with   seven  jewels, with  seventeen    jewels,  with   twenty-one    jewels   and   five adjustments.    If the  lid  of the  case   was   unscrewed,    one could  look  at the ticking  movement.     I had  gone  that  far. I had  asked  to  look  at the works.   The   ultimate   in watches, worn   by conductors    to determine    a train's arrival  and   departure,  might   have  twenty-three    jewels,  five  adjustments and  the minutes    as well  as the  hours  printed   on  the dials.\nA  railroad  watch.   Pending    a  purchase,   I  was  wearing    a dollar  Ingersoll.\n   On  the  north  side of  14th  and  Douglas    began   the movies and  girlie shows.   Iliked  to look  at the buxom    ladies  in black  tights, but  I  had  been  cautioned    that  inside, in  the dark,   anything    might    happen.    There    were    men   who picked   up   boys.   What    then   happened?      My    fear  was greater  than   my  curiosity.  I  tipped  the  scales  at seventyfour  pounds,   and  was   known   to  bleed  easily when    hit.\n   The   Moon,   a  movie  house   that  featured  Westerns,    was both   cheaper   and   not   so  dangerous.    Along    with   Tom\nMix,   Bill  Hart   or  Hoot    Gibson   I  might   see  the  latest installment   of  Pearl  White,    last seen  trapped    in the  pit with  the  octopus.\n\n   I might   watch    the  serial twice,  then   have  an   Eskimo\nPie  before   I went   to sit in  the  lobby  of  the  Paxton   and wait  for  Gertrude    and   my   father.  Sometimes     my   father might   be  there   at  the  cigar  counter   talking   with   Gertrade's  sister  Evelyn   while   he  waited    for us.  Gertrude was  a very  pretty  girl that  boys  and   men  whistled   at, but\nEvelyn   was  a  woman.    When     she  leaned  over  to  give  me gum   or  candy,   I would    smell  her  perfume    and   the  Sen\nSen  on   her  breath.   I had   seen   women    like  her   in the movies   Gertrude    liked  better  than   I did.  She  was   dark, like Pola   Negri,   and   smoked     cubebs   when    she  wasn't working.   My    father  said  it was   the  smoking    that  made her voice  so low   and  hoarse.\n  In  her  apartment    on  Dodge    Street, which   I had   visited with  Gertrude,    Evelyn   had  a piano   draped   with  a  shawl, lamps   fringed  with   beaded    tassels, and   the  smell  of  incense.  She  liked  it dark,   and  wore   a  wide-brimmed      hat that concealed    most   of her  face  but  not   her  lips. If she gave  me   money    I  would   carry   it around    in  my   watch pocket,  reluctant  to spend   it.\n  One   day   in the  summer    I came   back   from  the  park   to find  the  kitchen   floor  strewn    with   broken    dishes   and glasses, one   of the  side windows     broken   where    pots  and pans  had   been   thrown    into  the  yard.   In  their  upstairs bedroom    the  bureau   drawers    had  been   emptied,   some   of her  clothes  ripped   and   torn,  the  bedsheets   slashed,  face powder   and  talcum   spilled  over  the rugs,  trash  and  towels stuffed in  the bowl   of the  toilet.I didn't  want   to be  home when   my   father   returned,   so  I  hid  under   the  bleacher seats in  the  park.  I  thought   the  night  would    never  end.\nWhen    the last trolley  went  back   into town,   I crawled   into the  sandbox    and  slept  with   the  lid  down.   In  the  early dawn   light  I took  a walk   through   the  woods   on  the  west bluffs of the  Missouri,   from   where   I could  see the  sunrise on the  muddy    water.  To  have  seen  the  force of a  woman's rage  filled me   with   awe   and   pleasurable    apprehension.\nWith   my  father   I was  learning   about   eggs.  All by  myself\n\nI was  learning   about   life.\n\nOn  top  of the papers,  perhaps    to keep  them   from   blowing, was  a heavy   glass  ball  with  a castle  inside,  and  when    he took  this ball  and   shook   it, the  castle  would   disappear.\nQuite  a bit the  way   a farmhouse    on  the  plains  would   disappear   in a storm.   He  liked  to sit there, holding   this  ball, until the  storm   had  passed,   the  sky  would    clear, and   he would   see that  the fairy  castle  with   the waving    red  flags was  stillthere*\n   My   father  was  not  a  religious  man,   but  he  accepted   as a law  that  a  sinner  would    one  day  get  his comeuppance, and  he  had  got  his. It might   have   been  worse.   One   room upstairs    and   three   rooms    downstairs      had   been    left untouched.\n   We   were  soon   back  in  the  Maxwell     Hotel  on   Farnam\n\nStreet, where   I still knew   some   of the people   in the  lobby.\nWhen    they  asked   me  about   my   sister I said  that  she  had gone  to  work.   My    father  had   learned   quite  a  bit about the  egg  and   chicken   business,   so  we   took  our   meals   in cafes  that gave  us  meal   tickets for  chickens   and  eggs.  We had   meal   tickets  for all  parts  of  Omaha      except   downtown.   In one  my   father  called  the  \"greasy   spoon\"    we  always   ate baked   heart  and   dressing,  a  specialty.  I liked  to eat  with   my   father  and   listen  to  him   talk  to  the  cook behind   the  counter  or  the  man   seated  beside   him.  It flattered  most   strangers   to receive  his  attention.   He  did  not\n\n   *The Works ofLove.\n look  like a man   who   picked   his own   chickens   and  candled eggs.  The   coats of  his Hart,   Schaffner   &   Marx    suits had received   less wear   than  the  pants.   His  head   high   on  the pedestal   of his  stiffcollar,  he  looked   a lot  taller than   he proved   to  be  when    he  stood  up.   I don't   know    for how long  my  father   had  been  a  talker, only  about   when   it was\n\nI became    a listener. That   was   when   it was  just the  two  of us, and   I could  listen to him   talking  to someone    else  more than  to  me.  He   was  not  a reader,   so I  don't  know   where it was  he  got his  ear  for words.   It was   the words   he  used that  got  him   the  listeners,  along   with   the  easy   way   he joshed  them.   \"I  see here  ...\"  he  would   say,  with  nothing in his  hands   to look  at, as if he  was  reading   what   he  said out  of the  paper.   That   usually  caught    their attention   the way   it did  mine.   He   had   a good   vocabulary,    but  in  the butter  and   egg business   he  didn't  use  it much.\n\n   In  the middle   of life, with  his  best years  before  him,  he seemed   to  have  a firm   grip  on  all  serious  matters.  . ..In the  morning    there  was   usually   ice in  the pail  where    the dung-spotted     eggs   were   floating,  and    he  could   see  his breath,  as if he  were  smoking,    in the  candling   room.   If he seemed   to  spend   a good  deal  of time   every  day  looking   at one  egg  and   scratching   another,   perhaps   it was   the price one  had  to pay  for  being  a  man   of caliber.  One   whose   life was  still before  him,  but  so much   of it already   behind   him that  itseemed    that several   lives\u2014if  that  was   the word   for them  \u2014had    already   been  lived.  Had   already  gone   into  the limbo,  as  some   men  said.\n   There   were  evenings    that he  sat at the desk  in his  office, the  Dun    &  Bradstreet    open   before  him,   and  there   were other  evenings    that  he  spent   in  the  candling    room.   He would   take  a  seat  on  one  of his  egg  cases,  using   a  thick excelsior  pad  as  a cushion,   and  the  light from   the  candler wouldfall    on the  book  he  held  in his hands.   Dun   &  Br   i street?   No,   this  book   was   called  a  A   Journey     to  the\nMoon,    written   by  a foreigner    who   seemed    to have   been there.  His   son  had   read   this book,   then  given   it  to his father  to return   to the  library.  One  day   he  had  wondered what   it was  that  the  boy  liked  to read.  So  he  had  opened the  book   and  read  four   or five  pages   .. .after  reading   a few   more   pages   he  had   seated   himself   on  an  egg   case, adjusted   the  light.  The   candling    room    had  turned    cold before  he  closed  the  book,  and   when    he  stepped   into  the office it was  dark  outside*\n   My    father   always   introduced    me   to  strangers    as  his\n\"only   son.\"  I  understood    this  to be  a  compliment,     but  I did  not  know    why   until  I learned   from   a  teacher   that  I was   half  an   orphan.   That    was   only   half  as  good   as  a whole   orphan,    but  I knew   this  to be  a point  in  my  favor.\n\nI  made    a favorable   impression     on  the  grownups     in  the lobby,  having   been   raised  to respect   my  elders.  \"Yes   sir,\"\n\nI would    say, or  \"Yes   ma'am,\"    with   a bow   of  my  head.   I was   a  small   plump-faced      boy   with   a  sunny   nature    (I think)   and  a  chipped   front  tooth.  My   ears,  like  the handles  to  a  pan,  led  me   to  favor  caps   with   ear-muffs,   or high   crowns   that  I  could  lap  at  a rakish   angle   over  one ear.  In  this brief  period   of my   father's   bachelorhood     we were   almost   companionable.     In  a suit  designed   for boys   a year  or  two  older,  one  that  required   extensive   alterations,\n\n   * The Works ofLove.\n\nI was  shown   off at  breakfast   in the Harney    Cafeteria   and to the ladies  at the  Christian   Science  Church    on  Sundays.\nWe   were  Methodists     in Central    City,  but  my   father  felt the  Christian    Science   ladies  offered   better   pickings   as wives   and   mothers.   It  gratified  me   to  be   described   as\n\"quite   a  little man,\"    considering     that  I  was   half   an orphan.\n   In his  talk  with  these  ladies  I learned   from   my   father that he  was  anxious   to get  me  off the streets  and  back  into school.  I was   not  anxious,   since  I had   all day  to look  at the trains  and   games   in Brandeis'    toy department     or ride the escalator  in  Burgess   &  Nash.   A  man   or woman     might ask  me  to  deliver  a note,  for  a quarter.   If the  place  was all right, and  the  hall  wasn't  dark,   I would   slide the  note under   the  door  and   run.  If I  got cold  feet,  I would   just keep  the  money.   In  McCrory's     dime   store  on  16th  Street\n\nI swiped   a roll of  tire tape  I had  no  use  for, not  having  a bike.\n  One   day   I saw  my   father  driving  west  on  Harney    with a woman    at  his side, but  he  didn't  see me.  She  was   not so young   as  Gertrude,    but  dark,  with   a  hat  on.  I had  just assumed    my   father   was  down    at  his  business,   candling eggs  and  picking   chickens.   He   had   hired  a  man   to  help him  who   slept  on  a cot in the  back,  kept  a  low  fire going, and  made   deliveries.  He   was  not  much   of  a chicken   picker or  candler,  since  he  had   lost one  arm   in the  SpanishAmerican    War.   He   could   prove  that  by  just rolling  back his sleeve  on  the blue  stump.\n   The  day  before   Hallowe'en    we  moved    from  the  hotel to an  apartment     near  32nd    and   Dewey,    about   two   blocks west   of Farnam     School.    My    father  walked    me   to  the school, where    I met  the principal   and  Mrs.   Partridge,   the fourth-grade    teacher,   who   was   saddened    to  hear  that   I was  a  boy  without    a mother.    From    my   appearance    and behavior   she  thought   he  had   raised  me   very  well.  I was put  in one  of  the  smaller  seats  at  the front,  on  the  right side  of the   room   near   the   door   and   the  gramophone.\nRight   beside  me   was   a girl  named    Elizabeth,   and   right behind   me  a boy   named   Joseph    Mulligan,    the  firstboy   I had  met  who   wore   a bar  pin  on  the wings   of  his collar  to support   his tie.\n  Until   I entered   Farnam    School   I had  never   seen  a colored  boy  close  up.  I  had  seen   colored  janitors   in public buildings   and  colored   women    and   children  on  the  streetcars,  but  in  Mrs.    Partridge's   class  James    Smith    often stood  right beside  me   in the spelldowns.    His  big  feet were bare,  the bottoms   pink   as watermelon     when   it rained.  He had  holes   in his  pants  and   lacked   buttons   on  his  shirts.\nHis   skin  was   black   as  the  underside    of  a  stove  lid.  I looked   as  strange   to him    as  he  did  to  me,  and   in  the cloakroom    we   often  laughed    at  each   other.  He   was   so fun-loving   and  friendly   I may   have  felt that wearing    rags sort of pleased   him.\n   Edward    Dorsey    sat at  the  back  of  the  class  in a  desk high  enough    to  get his  long  legs  under.   He   was   a lean, copper-colored    young    man   with   orange   hair  on  his  peanut-shaped    head.  He   liked  to chase  white   boys.  When    he caught   one  he swore   a stream   of crackling   curses,  then  let him   go. Mike    Smith,  no  relation   to James,   was   a boy   so sooty  black  I feared  to touch  him,   feeling  itmight   rub  off.\nHe   never   said  a word    unless  called  on.  His   implacable hatred   was   so  intense   it included    everybody,    including\n\nJames   Smith.    I feared   to pass   him   on  the  stairs  or  be alone  with  him   in the cloakroom,    but  his contempt    was  so great  I don't  believe  he  ever  saw  me.   He  sat  and  walked alone.  In  the  class  photograph     only  his  eyes  and   white shirt are  visible. If there  were   any  black  girls in  the class\n\nI have  no  memory    of them.\n   In the  morning    we   pledged   allegiance   to the  flag, and exercised  to the  music   of \"The   Clockstore,\"    played  on  the gramophone.      During    the  exercises,  Joey    Mulligan,    the boy  seated  behind   me,   often  became   confused.    He  would bend   at the  knees   when    he  should   have   stood  erect,  or hop  up  and   down   when    he  should   have  raised   his arms.\nWhen    Mrs.   Partridge   asked   him   what   in the  world   was the trouble,  he  said that  when    I exercised,  one  of my   ears wiggled.   Watching    my   ear  wiggle   was  such   a distraction he became    confused.\n\n  I was   at first humiliated   by  this declaration,   but  I grew to take  pride   in it. No   other   boy  in  this class,  black  or white,  proved   to have  this power.   Nor   had  I known    about itmyself   until the  excitement    and  exhilaration   of exercising. On    Mrs.   Partridge's    suggestion    I exchanged     seats with  Joey,  whose    ears  were  not  affected   by what   he  was doing.  The   fuzz  was  like  a white   nap  on  his  pink  cheeks and   through   his  brushcut    hairdo    I could   see  his  pink scalp.  Everything     about   Joey   Mulligan     was   crisp  and scrubbed.   His  white  shirts  were  starched,   the wings   of his collars  pointed,    the  lines  in  his  black   stockings    were straight  up  and   down,   the  box   toes  of his  hook-and-eye shoes  were    polished.   My    shoes  were    new   enough,    but they  were  scuffed,  and   the knees   of my   pants  were   soiled and  puffed   where    I gripped    them   to  hoist  them   on  my thin legs.  No  one  had  seemed    to notice  that  the dirt  on my shirt collars  came   from   my  neck.   Joey  Mulligan     was   also bright  as  a whip   on  fractions,   long  division   and  the  capitals of  the  states.  When     he  waved    his  hand    to attract attention  he  half  rose out  of his  seat. To   avoid  scuffing  up his  shoes  he  did   not  play  in  the  cinder-covered     yard   at recess.  Nor   did   he  stop  and   play   marbles    until  he   got home   and   changed   his  clothes.\n\nIt is spring    in  Omaha,    Nebraska,     and   we   stand   in the cinder-covered     school  yard,  facing   the   members     of Mrs.\nPartridge's   fifth-grade   class.  The  class  is gathered    at the side  of the  building,   at  the  edge   of  the  red  brick   walk, between   two   small  trees that  are  wired  to the  ground.   The pupils  are  visibly  arranged    according   to  size and   sex, but certain  invisible  forces  have   also  been  at  work.   The   boys pair,  the  girls  group,    and   the  Negro     boys  stand    in  a choir\u2014except     for  the happenstance     that  their faces  cannot be seen.   Their  white   shirts are  as  ifin  suspension   against the dark   wall.  The  eyes  of Mike    Smith   are wide   open   and like bolt holes  in a  stove, but  those  of Edward    Dorsey   were lidded  just   as the  shutter   snapped.    So   were   the  eyes  of\nMrs.   Partridge,   who   had  turned   to speak   to Stella  Fry,  as she  often closed  her  eyes  when   she  had  to raise  her  voice*\n\n   * The Man  Who  Was There, 1945.",

    "full_text": "One      drizzly   day  in the  spring  Joey   asked   me  to  come\n       home   with   him  and   meet  his  mother.   The   mention of his  mother    flattered  and   impressed    me.   I had   never been  asked   to meet   a boy's  mother.    That   spring  in  1921 we  were   eye  to eye,  but  with   my   short  neck   I felt Joey looked  taller. Under    my  plump    chin  the wings   of  my  collar curled   to touch   my   cheeks.  The    fold of  my   pants  at the knee   concealed   a hole   in my   stocking.  He   treated  me to a Tootsie   Roll  at the  bakery,  then   we  walked   north   on\n27th   Street  to  the  foot  of  the  hill on   Capitol   Avenue.\nSmack    in the  middle   of the  hill was   a building   the  color of milk  chocolate   left in the sun.  Joey's   mother   was  waiting for  us in  the swing   on  the  porch.\n   Capitol  Hill  was  so  steep that  when   the  asphalt  got  hot it sagged   in ripples   we  could   see in  the  streetlight.  The\n\nCadillac   dealers  on   Farnam    Street   used  the  hill  to test their cars  on,  winter  and   summer.    Over   the  winter,  people with  bobsleds   coasted   so far  to the west   they  got tired walking   back.  The   Mulligan    house   was   flat,with   an upstairs and   a downstairs,    and   room   beneath   the  porch   at the front  to store  scooters,  sleds  and  stuff  like that.  Mrs.\nMulligan    was   waiting   for us  in  the  swing.  She   sat in  it sideways,   gripping   the  chain,   with  one   foot  dangling   so she could   push  off.\n   \"So  you're   Joey's  best   friend,\"  she  said,  and   hugged me.  When     she   stood  up   we   were   all  about   the   same height,  but  not so thick.  Joey  had   told her  that  I was  half an  orphan,   and   how   he  was  willing   to share   his mother with  me.  Did   that please  me?   I said  that  itdid.  If I wondered  why   the  shades   were   drawn   at  the  front windows, it was   because    Mr.   Mulligan,    a  newspaper      pressman, had  to work   most   of the  night  and   do his  sleeping   in the daytime.   She   led  us  down    a  dark   hallway,    where    gas hissed,  to a large  kitchen   with  a  half  curtain  at the  window.   She  could   stand  there  and   look  out,  but  neighbors could  not  look in. While    she was   making    us cocoa  I could hear  water   drip  in the  pan  under   the  icebox.\n   Just  two   years   before,  Mrs.   Mulligan     told  me,   they had  come    from  Salt  Lake   City   to Omaha.     In  Salt  Lake\nJoey's  little brother   Louie    had  died   of smallpox    in  the pesthouse.    I was    shown    a  picture   of  Joey   and   Louie wearing    boxing    gloves,  ready   to  fight  each   other.  Mr.\nMulligan    had   once  boxed   professionally    in Minneapolis,\nMinnesota,     where    Mrs.    Mulligan     had   first met   him.\n\"The    one  in  the  light tan  shoes   for  me,\"   she  said, and that  was  him.   What   was   it my  father  did?   I said that  he had  once  worked    for the  Union   Pacific  Railroad   but  that he was   now  in  the produce   business   for himself.   Ineedn't say any   more,   Mrs.   Mulligan    said,  since  she  had  heard from  Joey   that my   mother   was   dead   and  that  I was   half an  orphan.    Saying   this  brought   tears   to her   eyes.  She drew  me   to her  and  hugged    me.  I had  never  before   experienced  the gain  from   such  a  terrible loss. Mrs.   Mulligan said that  ifI so  desired, Joey   would   be  like a real  brother to me,  and  she  would   be like a  mother.  I so  desired  it,but the lump   in  my  throat  blocked   my   speech.  Joey   began   to cry, putting    his  arms   around    me,   and   Mrs.   Mulligan drew   us both   to her.  My    eyes  burned   with   tears, and   I buried  my   face in  her  lap. I couldn't   remember     ever crying so  hard,  and   feeling  so good   about  it. When    we   had stopped   sniffling Mrs.   Mulligan     cut me   a slice of  devil's food cake   to take  to my   father, and   Joey  walked   me   back to Farnam    Street  without    either  of us  speaking.   I had   a new   brother    whose     box-toed    shoes    squeaked     as  he walked.\n   Knowing     that  I was   half  an  orphan,    Mrs.   Mulligan wrote  my   father  a  letter that  I personally    delivered.  If I would   like  to come    and  live  with  them,   she   wrote,  she would   be  a real  mother   to me.  The   sum   of  five dollars  a week,  in  her  opinion,   would   care  for  the  food  I ate  and such  things  as my   laundry.   No  boy  should   grow   up  without  a brother,   and   if I came   to  live with   Joey  we   both would   have  one.\n   My   father  agreed   I could  live with  Joey   ifsome   of our furniture   went   along  with   me.  We   had   this parlor   suite he  no  longer  had   use  for, along   with  an   Axminster    rug and  two  hand-painted     oil paintings.  The   parlor  suite  had a sofa  that   turned   into  a  double   daybed    at  night.  The outside  half,  where   I  would   sleep,  curved   one   way,  and the inside  half, where   Joey   would   sleep,  curved  the  other.\nThere   was   also  an  oak  rocker   with  a  seat  so high   Mrs.\nMulligan's    legs were   too  short  to rock  it.The   Axminster rug  was   put  into  the  bedroom,    where   it made    the  noise less when   we   crossed  it in  the  morning.    Gertrude's    walnut  Victrola  was   put  in the  front  room   corner   where   the afternoon   sun   wouldn't   shine   on  it. Some   of  Gertrude's friends  had   almost  ruined   the  Harry    Lauder    records   by not troubling   to change   the  needle.  In the  dim  glow   of the gas jet, which    hissed  softly  all night,  I  could  see  the  oil painting   with  the  snow-capped      mountains    and   the  Indians  who   lived beside   the  lake  in their  wigwams.     I sometimes  felt I was  in hiding,   spying  on  them,   the  sunset  sky behind   the  mountains    as  red  and  sticky-looking    as  Dentyne  gum.\n  Around     the  house   Mrs.   Mulligan     wore   old  stockings that kept  the  kitchen   linoleum   shiny,  only  putting   on  her shoes  when   she  hung   out  the laundry.    In the  early  morning she  might   sit in the porch   swing   until  the lamplighter turned   off  the  streetlamps.     Even    the  milkman     would think  she  had  just  got up  and   was  one  of  these  early  risers, like he  was.  He   carried   so many    bottles  they  tinkled like glass  chimes   when   he  ran  between   the  houses.\n\n   If Mr.    Mulligan    had   not  been   asked    by  one   of his friends  to have  a beer  with  him,   which   he  couldn't  refuse, he would    come  down    the hill just  about  daylight,  walking in the  grass  to  ease  his  feet. If he  was   thirsty  he  might have  an  eggnog,   or  if he  was  tired  a fresh   cup  of coffee, then  he   would    come   to  the  crack   between    the   folding doors  to see  how   we   were  sleeping.   He   didn't  like us  to sleep  with   our  hands   under    the  covers.  He   said  a  boy never  knew   what   his hands   might   be  doing   while  he  was asleep.  I usually   had   my   hands   out  where   he  could   see them,   but  Joey   had  a  really  crazy   way  of  sleeping.   He put  his  head   down   low,   as if  he  was  trying   to hide   or crawl  into a  hole, with  his  bottom   up  high.  There   was  no way  in the  world   to tellwhere    his hands   were.  Mr.   Mulligan  would   tiptoe   in, not  to  wake   him,   then   give  him such  a  whack   across  the  butt  Joey   would   almost   put  his head  through   the  end  of  the daybed.   Lucky    for him,   that part of  itwas   padded.   The   last sound   I would   hear   from\nMr.   Mulligan    he  was   winding    his watch.   He   left it on the dresser,  which   made   the  tick so loud   I seemed   to hear itright  in my  pillow.   IfI opened    my  eyes  and  then  stared hard   at the  Victor   dog   in  the  horn   of  the  Victrola,   it seemed   to  me   the  ticking  sound    we  were    both  hearing was  his Master's    voice.\n   Until  I  had  a  place   at  Mrs.   Mulligan's    table  I  had known    very  little about   food.  At  the  greasy   spoon   near my  father's   place  of  business   I usually   ate  baked   heart and  dressing.   My   favorite  meal   at the  Harney    Cafeteria on Sunday    was  macaroni    and  cheese   with  a piece  of fresh rhubarb    pie. In  Salt  Lake   City   Mr.   Mulligan    had   run his own   ice cream   parlor,   where   he  sold his  own   sherbet and  hand-cranked     ice cream.   You  could  always   tell his ice cream    from   the  way   it  left wax    on  the   roof  of  your mouth.   On   Sundays   we   had  either  chocolate   or strawberry ice cream,   devil's  food  cake,  hot rolls or  biscuits,  roast pork  or  roast  beef  with  gravy   and  creamy    mashed    potatoes, vegetables   I didn't  eat, and   sometimes    a big  slice of runny   lemon    or butterscotch    pie.  Even   back   in  Minneapolis  Mr.   Mulligan    had   always   liked  plenty  to  eat. He made   his own   beer   in a crock   in the  pantry   which   sometimes  exploded    when   he  put  it into  bottles. Joey   showed me  the  glass that  sparkled   like  gems   in the  ceiling  of the stairs that led  down   to the  basement.    Most   of Mr.   Mulligan's  pay  went   for groceries   at  Bickel's,  or for  malt  and hops  at Weinstein's    Delicatessen,   but  Mrs.   Mulligan    said that  a man    who   worked    nights  had   little else to  do  but eat.\n\n   I was   catching   for our   team   and   Joey   Mulligan    was pitching  a  lopsided  baseball   with  a  lot of tire tape  wound around   it,when    the  batter  tipped  it and  I caught   it right on  the jaw.   It didn't  hurt   so much,    but  I  couldn't   talk.\nMy   jaw  wouldn't    move.   I dropped    my   catcher's  glove  in the  grass  and   just  took  off  and  ran.   I ran   about   three blocks,  the last  block  down    the alley  and   across  the yard into the  Mulligan    kitchen.  When    Mrs.   Mulligan    saw   me, my  jaw   hanging   slack,  she  gave  me   a hard   whack    across the back   and  it popped    into place.  I  was  sore  behind   the ears  for about   two   weeks   but  I  didn't  mention    it to my father.  He  wouldn't    let me   play  any  game   he  considered to be dangerous.\n   In  the  fall  Mrs.   Partridge    bought    us  a  new   league baseball   and  brought    it to the  diamond     where    we  were playing.  \"Throw     it!Throw     it!\" we  yelled  when    she  held itup   for us  to see it, but  she  had  never  thrown    a ball, so what   she  did  was  just  roll it.That   was   so surprising    we just looked   at her,  and  she  looked   at us.  Edward    Dorsey grabbed   the  ball and  rolled  it toward   second,  and   another player  rolled  it toward    first. We   ran  around    like  crazy, rolling the  ball  until  itwas   scuffed  and   dirty  like an  old one.  Something     else had   to  have  happened,     but  I  don't remember    what   it was,  and   I don't  want   to.\n  One    Saturday    Mr.   Mulligan     did  not  come   home.    At ten  o'clock  Mrs.   Mulligan     called  the  Omaha     Bee,   who said that  he  had   left with   his friend   Mr.   Ahearn.   Since they  sometimes     stopped   at  Mr.   Ahearn's,    on  25th   and\nDodge    Street,  Joey   and   I  went   over   to  look  for  him.\nRight   there  coming    down    Dodge    Street  were   two   cars, with  Mr.   Mulligan    at the  wheel   of the  one  being  pushed by  a  Butternut    Bakery    wagon.   They    made    the  turn  at\n26th  Street,  then  went   along   so  slow  and   easy  we   went right  along  with   them.   Mr.   Mulligan     looked   great.  We had  had   no  idea  he  knew    how   to  drive  a  car.  Over   on\nCapitol  he  didn't  need  to be pushed,   and   he was   allon  his own   as  he  took   it down    the  alley,  which    hadn't   been paved.  Joey   and  I went   ahead   of him,   picking   up  bottles and  cans,  to where   he  could  let itcoast  into  the Mulligan yard,  right  up  to the  rear  porch.   There    he squeezed    the rubber   horn  on  the driver's  side and   Mrs.   Mulligan    came out to  look  at it.It was   just a  Ford,  not  a Willys   Knight or a  Pierce   Arrow    with  lights  in  the  fenders,  but   there were  leather   straps  holding   down   the  hood,  with   a crank in the  leather  sling  at the  front. Why    didn't  he  crank   it?\n\nIt wasn't   quite  ready  yet  to be  cranked.   The   great  thing about  the  car,  which   was  seven   years  old, was   that  all it had  done   for six  years  was  just  sit, so that  the  tires, the leather  cushions   and   the  engine   were  just  like  new.   We could  see  that. All  it really  needed   was   tuning   up.  Like any  fine  piece  of  machinery     that  had   sat  without   running\u2014like    a good   watch   or Joey's   bicycle\u2014what      itneeded before   it ran  at  all was   to be  taken   apart   and  oiled.\nThat   would   take  a little doing,  but  Mr.   Mulligan     would have  the  help  of  Mrs.   Mulligan's     brother,  visiting  from\nMinneapolis,    a  man   so  big  he slept  crosswise   on  his  bed and  wore   size eleven  shoes.  If they   were  just  sitting there empty   on  the  floor,  we  could   step  right  into  them    with our  own   shoes  on.\n   Mr.  Lindstrom     was  a  plumber,   not  a  mechanic,   but  he knew   that what   you  took  apart   had  to be  put back   together in  the  same   order.  To   make   sure   they  didn't  make    a foolish mistake   they  put  a number     on every  part  they  took off,along   with  the nuts  and   bolts, ifthere  were   any.  They hung   the  parts  in  the  tool shed   as  they  came   off, so  all they  had   to  do  was    reverse  the   order.  After   ten  days, which   was  three  days  longer   than  he  had  meant   to stay  in the first place,  Mr.   Lindstrom    had   to get back   to Minneapolis,  but   Mr.   Mulligan     still had   his  afternoons    and weekends    until  the  time   came   to pave   the  alley. Putting the car  back  together   was  not  the  same   as taking   itapart.\nHe   never  had   the piece   he seemed    to need   when    he  was under   the  car. Once   he  thought    he  had  it almost   put  together  till he found   some   bolts  that had   to go somewhere.\nWhen    the  time  came  to fill the yard  with   sand  he  stillhad a  dishpan    full of  loose  parts.   He   could   get  the  car  to cough   a little when    he cranked    it,but  not  kick  back.   He didn't  seem   to mind   when    the  sand  trucks   appeared    and dumped    the  sand   all around   it almost   up  to the  hubcaps.\nMrs.   Mulligan    thought    it looked  like  a lawn   swing,   and in  some   respects   she  liked  it even  better.  With    the  side curtains   up, Joey   and  I could   sleep  in it.\n\n  All  that  sand   in  the yard   meant    that  Mrs.   Mulligan had  to  hang   her  washing    in  the kitchen,   with   the  floor covered  with  newspapers     to catch  the  drip. Somewhere      in the sand   pile Joey   lost  his St.  Christopher    medal   and   I lost two  chameleons,    both   for good,  that  I had   bought   at the Hagenbeck     and   Wallace   circus.  They   were   there  just as plain  as day  one  minute,   and   then  they  were  gone.  On the good   side,  the sand   stopped    Leonard    Seidel  and   his little brother   from   using   the  back   yard   as  a  shortcut, whooshing    beneath   Mr.   Mulligan's    window    before  he  got up.  On   the  good  side,  too, was   that  the  sand  was   there when   Mr.   Mulligan    threw   Joey  through   the  pantry   window.  Working     nights  the  way   he  did, and   sleeping  days, made   him  subject  to  fitsof temper.   Joey   would   often  forget just what   time  it was   when   he  was   fighting  with  me, which    was   pretty   often,   his  voice   being   louder    and hoarser  than   mine   was.  The   time  it happened    Mr.   Mulligan  didn't  say a  word,   either  before  or  after. He   came out  of the  bedroom     silent as  a  ghost  and   got  Joey  cornered  before  he  could  run,  gripped   him   by  the collar  and the  seat  of his  pants   and   threw   him   right  through    the screen  at the  pantry   window.    It didn't  hurt  him  any,  but ittore  all the buttons   off his  shirt.",

    "full_text": "Next door   to the  Mulligans,     up  the  hill, lived  Mr.\nL  \\  and   Mrs.  Goodman      and  their  twelve  children,   nine of them   girls. Mr.   Goodman,      a  short,  broad-shouldered man   with  a huge   head,  appeared    to have  only  stumps    for legs, like a man    walking   on  his knees.   He  worked    in the streetcar  barns  and   rode  the  streetcars  free.  Mrs.   Goodman   spoke   no  English,   but  she  sat  in the  swing   on   the front porch   shouting   orders   to her  daughters    in Yiddish.\nThe   oldest  boy,  Davy    Goodman,     had   a  full round    face with  big dark   eyes, but  very  spindly  legs. When    I came   to live on the  hill he was   having  a  feud  with  Joey  Mulligan.\nFrom    his uphill   position,  at  the  front  of  his  house,  he would   shout   at Joey,  using   the  secret curses   of the  Yiddish  language,   which    were   pretty  good.  What    Joey   understood   was  bad  enough,    but  what   he didn't  understand enraged   him.  His   face flushed   to purple.   The   veins  stood out  in his neck.   If Davy   Goodman      would   come   down    on\nJoey   Mulligan's    level, Joey   would    break   every  bone   in his yellow    Jewish   body.   Joey   had   as  loud   a voice\u2014or louder\u2014as     anybody,   but  he  didn't  have  Davy   Goodman's vocabulary.   I took  Joey's   side, standing   close  by  with  my arms  crossed   on my   chest,  my  legs  straddled.  My   jaw  was set, but  my  ears  were   open.  I had   never  heard   or seen  in a boy   so small   such  fluent,  venomous,     wonderful    curses.\nHe  also  had  the  scathing  looks  and   the gestures.  Atop   the four-foot  wall,  as he  was,   neither  did  he  look  so small  as he would    have  down   on  our  level.\n   Naturally,    I was   Joey's   loyal  friend,  but   I was   also confused   by  so much   talent.  It shamed   me   to admit   it,but\n\nI admired     Davy   Goodman.      In  his  fury   he  would    spit, then  grind  his heel  on  it,rolling  his sleeves  up high   on his spidery  arms.   I could  have  outwrestled    him   in a jiffy, but ifI didn't  grab   him  he  would   give  me  a nose  bleed,  being quick  with  his  fists.\n   Davy   and  his smaller   sisters went   to a grade   school  five blocks  to the  east, near  Central   High    School,  from   where they  had   been  sent  home    when   the  visiting  nurse   found lice in  their  hair.  Mrs.   Mulligan     had   been   stunned    to hear  it,but  not  surprised.   Mrs.  Ahearn,    who   had  been   in the  Goodman     house,  reported   that  it lacked  rugs  and  furniture.  Strong   odors   blew   out   of the  kitchen.   The    two older  Goodman      girls, Esther   and   Ruth,   fought   over  the boys  who    came   to see  them.   On   hot  summer    nights   Esther  might  be  seen  dousing   herself  with  the  sprinkler,  naked  as  a baby.   When    Kopfer   called  the  police  they  came in  a squad   car  and   parked    at the  front  of  the  house   to watch   her. In  her  loud,  hoarse  Jewish    voice  Esther  shouted curses   at them   until  they  went   away.\n\nThe   windows     open,   the  draft  through    the  house   would bring  the  smell  of the  iron, of the  sprinkled   clothes,  of the scorched   smell  of the starch,  to where   he  lay on  the daybed in the  living  room.   The  creak   of the  ironing   board  would sometimes    put  him   to sleep,  sometimes     keep  him   awake.\nMrs.   Mulligan      liked  to  iron   in  her   slip,  the  bottom pinned   up   so the  draft  would   blow   cool  on  her  legs,  her hair piled   up  high  like  a turban   so it would   also  blow   on her  neck.  She   did  not  trust  ironing   to  the  laundry.   His shirts were   an  especial  problem    due  to the  shortness  of his neck,  which   flattened  the  collars and   made   the  points  curl up.  Pins  to  support   the  tie did  not  help.  Mrs.   Mulligan took  pride   in his  appearance     and   never   let him   wear   a shirt more   than   three  times,  and  straightened    the  lines in his  stockings   before  he  left the  house.   The   paper    lining was   also left in  his new   caps.   Boys   who   wore   their caps over  one  ear  were   only fit to  be with   the  Western    Union, as they flew   past  him, furiously   pumping,     their butts  wagging   high   on  the  saddles,   racing   off  to some   forbidden pleasure   with  waitresses.*\n   A  pair   of unalike   twins,   Burgess    and   Byron    Minter, the  only  boys  in class smaller   than   I was,  played  music   on\nFriday   afternoons,    Byron    the  violin,  Burgess    the  piano.\nIn  order  to  reach  the  pedals,   only  part  of Burgess    rested on  the  bench.  They    were  often  accompanied     by  Betty   Zabriskie,  owl-eyed,    moon-faced,     red-lipped,   with   her  long\n\n   *One  Day, 1965.\n doughnut    curls   dangling   down    to  rest  on  the  cello.  To brush   against   Betty  Zabriskie    in  the  cloakroom,    or  exchange   a greeting   on  the stairs, stirred  me  in  a way   I had not experienced    with   other  girls. She  wore   half  socks, exposing   the  plump    knees   straddling   her   cello. I  was   responsive   to music,   as well  as  to Betty   Zabriskie,   and   my experience   with   Gertrude    stood  me  in  good  stead  when    I would   wind   the  Victrola,   put  on  the  records  and   change the  needles.   \"The   Clockstore,\"     my   first favorite  music, gave   way   to  \"Humoresque\"          and   Liszt's   Hungarian\nRhapsody    no.  2, selections  that  were   featured   in the  Music Memory     Contest.   While   the  music   played,   Mrs.   Partridge  stood   at  the  back   of  the   room   looking    out  the window,    or over  the  floor  register  where   the  heat  puffed out her  skirts.  I longed  to  give her  something    but  scorned the apples   given  to  her  by  girls. She  suffered   from  headaches  caused   by chalk   dust, and  during   recess  would   often lie down    on  the  cot  in the  nurse's   room   off  the  annex.\nHer   bone   hairpins    were   often   on  the  pillow,   and   the smell  of her  galoshes   in the  closet.\n  In  the  dead   of the  winter,  during    and  after  Christmas vacation,  anybody    with  a  sled came   from   all over  to Capitol Hill. The   steep  grade   leveled  off at  27th  Street,  with a long  clear  coast  to 28th.   If the  track  was   hard  and   icy some   sledders  might   go  around    the  corner  to  Davenport.\nThe   early  sledders  were   usually   the  duffers,  who   packed down   the  snow   and   cleared   a trail so  we  could   walk   up the hill. The   best  sleds  were   Flexible   Flyer  Junior   Racers, which   were  low   to the  snow   and  tapered   down   at the back.  With    a second   rider  to  give  the sled  a  good   push, then  crouch   down   between    the  legs  of the  steerer, by  the time  you  hit  the  level at the  bottom    of the  hill you  were flying.  It hurt  to  breathe.   Your   cheeks   would    be  numb and   your  eyes   watered.   The    long   walk   back   gave  you time  to recover   and  watch    the  other  sledders   whoosh    by you.  Where   the  ice was   worn   thin on  the  bumps    the runners  gave  off sparks.\n   In January     the bobsleds   would    come   from   somewhere and  rumble    down   the  hill  like runaway    trucks,  as  many as  fifteen kids   squeezed   tight  on   the  seat.  Cross   traffic would   be   stopped   on  27th   Street   when    the  bobs   came down    the  hill. It  all ended    the  winter   that   something went   wrong     and   the  driver   couldn't    steer.  'The   bob jumped    the  curb  at  the  bottom   and   plowed   through    the basement    wall  of a  house,   killing three   kids. One    of the girls we  knew   was  all broken   up.  It took  us a  while  to get back   to sledding   and   come   in  with  our   cheeks   cracked, our  lips chapped     and  sore,  our  toes  itchy  with  frostbite, but  our  blood   hot  with  the  fever  of our  excitement.    The week   I had   a  bad  felon  and   couldn't  go  out  and   slide  I thought   I would   die.\n\n   I gave  up  sledding  for  ice skating  on  the frozen   pond  of\nTurner    Park.    Billy  Worthington,      a  freshman    in  high school,  was   the first boy  I  knew   who   was   good  at  everything.  He  wore   fur  gloves  that  reached   to his elbows   and nobody   could   catch him   when   we   played  \"I  Got  It.\" Billy\nWorthington     had   it, as well   as hockey    shoe  skates  with tube  blades.  Getting   my   skates  sharpened     took  all of my spending    money,   but  ice skating   was  the  first sport  I excelled  in. Billy Worthington      said so. \"You're    pretty  good, kid,\"  he  said, and  I really  was.\n\n   In  the  spring   and  summer     daylight   we  usually   numbered   five to seven,  but  at  night  under   the  streetlight  we would   double   that number,    including   most   of the girls but not  Davy    Goodman's     sisters.  We   played    games   of  pursuit, the  darkness   heightening    the  excitement,    the climax full of shrieks   and  frenzied   screaming.    Racing   across   the back   yards   crossed   with   sagging   clotheslines,   we   hung ourselves  by  the chin  and   set the wires   to strumming.    The night  was   full of  cries, and   not  all of  them   friendly.   In those  houses   without   children   what   was  it like?  On   Hallowe'en    we   soaped    windows,      rang    doorbells,    threw strings  of cans   and  pails  onto   porches,   reversed   garbage pails so the  lid sat on  the bottom,   howled    like cats, barked like dogs,  put  toads  and  mice   into  mailboxes.   An   enraged neighbor,   hoarsely   panting,    having   cunningly    set  a trap for me,  chased   me  for  blocks  between    and  around    houses, tripping  and   falling, muttering    curses,  until he  groaned   to collapse  in the  same   empty   lot where    I was   hiding  in  the weeds.  I could   hear  him   talking  to himself,   moaning.    Did he live to  remember     the little fiend  he  chased   but  did not catch?\n  On    the  Fourth   of July,   up  with   the  clop  of  the  milk horse  and  the  rattle of the  bottles, Joey   and  I would   shoot off our  little hoard   of  firecrackers   before  breakfast.   The long,  long  day   would   be  spent   walking    along   the  curbs looking   for firecrackers   that  had   not  gone  off. At  a  risk, these  stillmight    be  lit,or  cracked   in half  and   the  black powder    heaped     in  a  pile  and   ignited.   In  this   way   I burned   the  fuzz  off my   cheeks,   the  lashes  from   my   eyes, and  singed   my   eyebrows.    They   would    grow   back.  I  was advised  not  to do  it again.\n   In  the  late afternoon    on  a  Fourth   of  July   hazy   with heat  and   the  smoke    of burning    powder,     Mr.   Mulligan appeared    at the  top  of the  hill with   his pressmate,    Mr.\nAhearn.   They    carried  large  paper   bags  from   which    Roman   candles  and  skyrockets   protruded.   They   sang   as they approached,     which    brought    Mrs.    Mulligan     from   her ironing  to stand  at  the screen.  We   were   called  inside; the front and   the  rear  doors  were   locked.  From    the  upstairs bathroom    Joey   and  I  had   a bird's-eye   view  of  the  proceedings.  Neighbors    had  gathered   on  the  porches  of  nearby  houses.   They   began   with   pinwheels,    fastened   to the porch  posts,  but not  very  spectacular   in the  daylight.  The sparklers  threw   off sparks   like a knife  sharpener's    grindstone,  and  we   could   hear  most   of  the  people   laughing.\nSmall  as  he was,   foolish as  he was,  with   his shirt  off and his pants  cuffs  turned  up,  there  was  something    about  Mr.\nMulligan    like  a big  firecracker   lying  in  the  gutter  that hadn't  gone   off. He   gave  the  skyrockets   to  Mr.  Ahearn, and  selected  the Roman    candles   for himself.  They   weren't much   to see, light  as itwas,   but nobody    knew   where   they might  come   down.   He   shot  some  at  the Goodmans,     clearing them   all off  the porch,   then  he  shot  them   at the  second-floor   windows    of the  house   right  below   us. Some    of the  windows    were   open,  the  curtains   drawn   back   to stir up  a  breeze.   We   couldn't   see  too  well  from   our   angle what   happened,    but we   could  hear  the  shouting   and  yelling.  Lillian's  father,  Mr.   Kovack,    who   had   the  day  off from   his Railway    Express   truck,  ran   into the  yard   waving  his arms,   until Mr.   Mulligan    aimed   a  candle  at  him and  he  took  off. When     he  ran  out  of Roman     candles  he helped   Mr.  Ahearn    with  the skyrockets.   They   smoked   going  up,  then   they   smoked    even  more    when    they  came down   on  somebody's    roof.\n\n   When    the big  car with  the  side curtains  came   down   the hill, we  could  see  the  two  men   in  the  front seat  peering out through    the windshield.    They   waited  until  Mr.   Mulligan  had  run  out  of rockets,  then  one  of the  men   opened the  door  and  called  to him.   There   was   a big  nightworks display  out  in  Fontenelle    Park,  he  said,  and   the  mayor had  sent  him  to ask  if he  and  his friend  would   be  part  of it.He   did it so nice, his  tone  so respectful,  Mr.   Mulligan sat  down   on   the  steps  to think   it over.  He   was   pretty tired, and  one  of his  hands   was  burned,   but  we  could  see that  it appealed   to  him.  Mr.   Ahearn    had   no  say  in the matter   and  just  stood   waiting   for  him   to make    up   his mind.  So  did  everybody   else.\n\n   It was  hard  for  me  and  Joey   to believe  that two   grown men   would   be taken   in by  the cops  with  a  story like  that, but  they  were.   They   both   put  back   on  their  shirts  and jackets\u2014Mr.      Mulligan     wore   sweaters    with   four  front pockets\u2014then      they  leaned   on   each  other   to  keep  from falling  down    when    they   crossed   the  yard.   This   little plainclothes   cop  got  out  of the  car  and  made    a big  bow when   he  opened   the  rear  door  and  pushed    them   both  in.\n\nIt shamed    me   so much    to see  it, itmade    my   ears  burn, and   he  was   not  even  my   father.   When    they   left,Joey locked   himself    in the   bathroom     and   bawled.    All  the neighbors,   of course,  laughed   till they  were  sick, with  the exception   of  Mrs.    Kovack,    who   had   had   her   curtains scorched   by a  Roman    candle.\n   Mrs.   Mulligan    vowed   she  would   not  let him   in  when the  cops  brought    him   back,  which    they  actually   didn't, and   the  first we  saw   of either   of them   was   when    they came   down    the  hill  two  mornings     later  with  the   milk wagon.    Finding   the   door  locked,   he  sat  quietly   in  the porch  swing    until Mrs.   Mulligan     felt sorry  for him   and lethim   in.\n\nThe  first thing  he  did, before  he  went   to bed, was   put  his seven-jewel    watch,   with   its chain,   out  on   the  dresser, where   it ticked  so  loudly  we   could  all hear   it. The  first sign of him   being  up  and  about   was  the sound   of his shoes being  polished,  the  cloth snapping     like a whip   at the  end of the stroke,  the  smell  of the  wax   strong   in the  kitchen.\nUntil  he had  shaved   at the kitchen   window,    where  just  his lathered  face  showed    above  the  half  curtain,  he  wore   his snug   whipcord    pants   with  the  straps  of  his braces   dangling,  his  underwear     unbuttoned     to  expose   the  crinkly hair on  his chest. Nothing    could  have  been   more  commonplace,  but it lefton  the  boy a  lasting  impression.   No  ordinary  mortal   rose so  late in the  day  and  walked    around   as he did,  wearing   harness,   as ifunhitchedfrom      the  work   he had  accomplished     while  asleep*\n   A  glorious  day  in  October,   my  father   took  Mr.   Mulligan,  Joey   and   me   to the  Omaha      Western    League    ball park  to  see Babe   Ruth   and   Bob   Meusel,   of the  Yankees, on  a  barnstorming     tour.  My    father  had   bought   us  box seats  along  the  first-base  line, where   we   were   out  in the open   and  could  catch  foul  balls.  Early  in  the game    Babe\nRuth   hit one  which   Mr.  Mulligan     stood  up and   caught  in his  bare   hands.   Late   in  the   game,   with   Bob    Meusel pitching,  Babe   Ruth   hit  a home   run   so high  it went   over the  flagpole  in center  field. Nobody    saw  it come  down.   As\n\n   *One Day.\n the Babe   trotted  around    the bases,  Mr.   Mulligan     slipped me  the  foul  ball  he  had   caught   and   said,  \"Go   get  him, kid!\" At  that  point   Babe   Ruth   was  just  rounding    second, and  in the  confusion,   with   everybody   yelling,  I cut  across the diamond    between    first base  and  third  and   caught   him coming    toward   the   plate.  Maybe     there  were   already    a gang  of  kids  behind   me  with   the  same   idea. In  any   case,\nBabe   Ruth   wheeled    around    and   headed    for the  dugout, but  not  before  I had   got a  grip  on  the  rear  pocket  of  his pants.  I suppose    other  kids  got  a grip  on  me,   and  in  the tussle that  followed   I lost the  foul  ball, but  I stillhad   the pocket  to  his  Yankee    pants.  A  flannel   pocket   was   of no use  to Mr.    Mulligan,    but   I used   it to kneel   on  in  wet weather,   or  rest my   knuckles   on  when    I played   marbles.\n\nIt brought   me  luck  until  I lost it. It disappeared    with   the cigar  box  full of my   marbles    when   I hid  it so well  somewhere   I forgot  where   it was.\n\n   I lived   with   Joey   Mulligan,     but   I had   some    other friends.  Douglas    Fudge    was  my   friend,  older  and   bigger than  I was,   with  an  airgun   that  he  let me   shoot  at birds with.  Orville  Browning,     whose   father  was   an Indian,   was a wizard    with   magnetos,    electric  buzzers,   and  made    his own   crystal   sets  out   of oatmeal     cartons.   The   craziest friend  I ever  had  was  Shelley,   whose   last name   I forget  or maybe    I never  knew   it.\n   One   day  I was   playing   pocket   billiards  with  him   on  a man-size    table  in  his  grandmother's     attic.  Never   before had  I played   real  billiards.  My   game   was   really marbles, but  on   the  previous   day   Shelley   had   won    all of  them, including    my   shooters.  We    had   played   in  the  soft  dust under   the  porch   because   the  yard   was   covered   with   an\nApril  snow.   Snow    glare  had  blazed   at the  holes  between the porch   slats.  What    marbles   I  didn't  lose to  Shelley   I lost in  the  dust.  He   gave  me   some   of  them   back   so  we could  go on  playing,  but  it wasn't  the  same,  and   he felt it.\n   \"You're   no  good   at marbles,\"    he  said,  \"let's play   billiards.\"  At  the back   of the  lunchroom     across  from   school hooded   lamps   hung   over the  tables, sucking   up  the  smoke.\nOn  the  wires  overhead    there  were   counters   that the  players pushed   around    with  their  cues.\n  Just   above    his  right  knee   Shelley    had   holes   in  his britches  where    he  reached   down   to  pull  up  his  stocking.\nHe  crouched    with  one  knee  cocked   when   he  was  shooting, holding   the pocket   to keep  the  marbles   from   spilling. The way  his  pockets  bulged   at  his knees   he looked   pretty  silly ifhe  wasn't   playing   marbles.\n   In a  serious  discussion    he would    twist  his cap   around so the  bill was   at  the  back,  like a  racing   driver.  On   his shooting    hand   his  knuckles    were   always    chapped     and sore.  He   was   a  shark.   No   matter    what   he   played,  he played   for keeps.\n   Aside  from   how   he  looked,   he never   wore   a coat,  as if he  didn't  have  one.  He   would    look  right  at me   with   his teeth  chattering   and  say  he wasn't   cold. My    opinion   ishe didn't  feel it, which    might   help  account   for  his  unusual behavior.   Almost   anything   might   strike  him  as funny,   like a person's   name.   When    he  learned  what   my   name   was   he almost   broke  up.  Without     knowing    whether    I could  play marbles    or  not,  he   was   dumbfounded       to  learn   that  I could.  \"You   play  marbles?\"    he  said. I thought    he'd  laugh himself   sick.  He   just  took  it for  granted   that   whatever game   he  played,   he played   best.  His  manner     of laughing was  to turn   away   and  lean  on  his  knees,  like he  might   be sick, or walk   around   in  a circle with   his head   on one  side, his teeth  clenched.   He   stood  still so seldom    I don't  really know   if he was   smaller  than   me,  or only  looked   it,but  my impression    was  he  was  short   and  underfed.\n   Shelley  slept  in a  flat on  Dodge    Street  with  his  father, but  he  lived with   his  grandmother.     Since   she  didn't  play billiards,  he  had   this  big  man-size    table  all  to himself.\nWe   each   had  our   own   chalk,   but  we   had   to take   turns with  the  only  cue   that  had  a  tip. Owing    to  the  fact that the attic  wafs so  narrow,   we   had  to do  all of  our  shooting from  the  two  ends,  lying  out  on  the table  to make    the side shots. Balls  that  fell into the  pockets   were   sometimes    never seen  again.  They    rolled  around   in  the alleys  under   the table, or  collected  in one  pocket   until  itwas   stuffed.  Shelley's arms   were  so thin  he  could  work   them   into  the pockets until they  were   up  tight  under   his armpits.   Sometimes he  would    do  that   and   then   scream    for  help,   as  if he couldn't  get  them   out.\n   On  our   way   to the  attic we   would    stop  in the  kitchen and  look  for something    to  play  keeps  for.  In a sugar   bowl his grandmother      kept  Necco    wafers   she  liked  to suck   on while   she  was    ironing.   Gingersnaps,      if they   had   any, were   stored  in a  crock  in  the pantry.   To   make   them    soft and  chewy,   the  way  he  liked  them,   Shelley  would    put  one to soak  on  the  roof  of his  mouth.   If it soaked   too  long  he would   have   to use  a  finger  to  pry  it loose.  It didn't  surprise  me   much    when    he   said,  \"You're   no   good   at  billiards, let's play  poker.\"\n   Poker   was  played   by  men   in the  backs  of  saloons  and   I feltcorrupted   just  to hear  about   it. But  I had  to  do something.  If I didn't do  something    it would   be  too  late.\n  \"I'm   not  a cardplayer,\"    I said.  \"I'm  a  runner.\"\n  He   had   gingersnap    dough   caked   around    his teeth,  and his tongue    worked    at  it as he   looked   at  me.  \"You're    a what?\"   he  said.  He   had  never   seen  me  run,   but  my  best running   was   done  in and   out  of streetlights,  where   it was hard  to see  me.  Just  to take  off and  run   in broad   daylight was  new   to us  both.\n\n  I did  my   best running    at about   twenty   yards,  but  I was pretty  good  up   to fifty if I was  being   chased.   I guess   my best short  type  of run  was   in Shelley's   back  yard.  He   was so close  at my   side I  could  see  his head   twisted,  with   his teeth clamped    hard   like they  pained    him.  Right   when   he was  just  about   even  with   me  he  let out  a  wild  hoot   and sprawled   on   his face.  His   grandmother      came   out  of  the house   to lift him  up   and  brush   him   off. She   made   some ice-cold  lemonade    for us  and  we   sat on  the  stoop  sucking the ice  and  eating   cookies  as  if nothing   special  had   happened.  We   didn't  discuss  the  race  at all, or who   had   won.\nOne   thing  I do  know    is, from  the  looks  he  gave  me,   that he  saw   it all differently   than   I  did,  but  I  could   never imagine   what   he  might   be  like if he ever  grew   up.\n   Several  months    might   pass  before   I saw   my   father,  or received   one  of  his  letters  enclosing    a  check   for  Mrs.\nMulligan,    a  dollar   bill for  me.   The   check   endorsed,    I would   offer  it in  payment    on  one   of the  weekly    bills at\nBickel's  grocery.\n   One   day  Mr.   Bickel  returned   this  check  to  me  because the  bank   would    not  cash   it. The   shame    I felt  walking home   with   this check   may   have  exceeded    all my  previous torments.   With   little or  no  cause,   I had   stored   up  and nourished    considerable   pride.   That   my   father  was   lowered  in the Mulligans'    opinion   also  lowered   me.  Joey  and\n\nI were   so  evenly  matched    we   each  sought   an   advantage over  the  other,  which   he  now    had.  The   first bad   check was  soon   followed  by  another.   My    dread   of these  checks was  soon   greater  than   my   shame   at  their absence.   With the bad   check  I would    make   the  long  trip  to my   father's place  of business,   which   I often   found   locked.  If he  was there, he  would   write   me  a new   check,   which   I feared  to bring  back  with   me.  What    good  were   they  if Bickel's  refused  to  accept   them?   My    pride   and   shame   led  me   to think  that  I might    support   myself.   Davy   Goodman      sold newspapers     on  24th  and   Farnam,    and   when   Floyd   Collins was   trapped   in the  cave  he  made    almost  f\\ve  dollars selling extras.\n\n   I began   to sell papers   on  24th  and   Farnam,    and  made as much   as  forty cents  a night.  I learned   that more   money was  made    on delivery   routes,  and  got  a route  downtown, between    Douglas    and  the  post  office. I  liked  the  excitement   of so many    different   people  and   the  dark  hallways of the  boarding    houses.   I made    as much    as  four  or  five dollars  a week,   and  gave  three  and  a  half to  Mrs.   Mulligan.  It hurt  her pride  to  accept  it,and  gave  me  back   some of the  advantage   I  had  lost. Making    real  money    like that restored   my  self-esteem.    If my   father's  infrequent   letter enclosed   a  check,  I tore  it  up.  To  restore   my   father  in\nMrs.   Mulligan's   eyes,  as well  as to  give myself   something\n\nI badly  wanted,    I presented   myself   a watch   at Christmas\n\nI had  bought   in  a pawnshop,     but said  my   father  gave  me.\n\nIt looked  small  in its wrapping,    so I devised   the stratagem of wrapping    it in a  series of  boxes,  each  one  larger,  till I had  a package   big  enough   for  a train  set. Iwas   so pleased with  what    I had   done  I  have  no  idea   how   it impressed\nMrs.   Mulligan.\n   In the  seventh   grade  at  the Farnam     School   my  teacher was  Miss   Healy,   a  big  reddish-haired    woman     who   wore mascara   on  her  eyelashes.   She  scandalized   the  PTA   meetings,  sitting on   a corner   of  her  desk   with  one   tapering silk-clad  ankle   dangling.    If she   spoke   to  me   my   heart pounded.    She  knew    about   men   and  boys.   In conferences concerned    with  my   selection  to speak   to the  fourth  grade about   Honor    or  the  sixth   grade   about   Hookey,    or  the duties\u2014soon     to be  mine\u2014of     a crossing  guard   at 29th   and\nFarnam,    I experienced     emotions   that  dried   my   lips. She selected  me   and   not   Helen    Tylor,   who   starred   in  the plays  and  recited  poems,    to give  the speech   of acceptance and  thanks   to the  Daughters     of the  American     Revolution on  the  gift  of a  scroll  about   which    I have   forgotten.   I muffed   the  speech.  My   disgrace   brought   tears  to my   eyes.\n\nIt also  rewarded    me   with  the  weight   of  her  arm   around my   shoulders,  and   a womanly     glance  from   her  mascaraed eyes.  Orville    Browning     told  dirty   stories  about   her   I wanted   to  believe.\n\nHow    did the fight  start? If there  is room  for speculation,   it lies in how   to end  it. Neither   the  white  boy  nor  the  black boy  gives  itfurther  thought.   They   stand,  braced  off, in the cinder-covered    school  yard,  in the  shadow   of the  darkened red  brick  building.   Eight   or  ten  smaller   boys   circle the fighters,  forming    sides. A   small   white   boy  observes   the fight upside   down   as  he hangs   by  the knees  from   a rail in the fence. A  black  girl pasting   cutouts  ofpumpkins      in the windows    of the annex   seems   unconcerned.     Fights  are  not so unusual.   Halloween     and   pumpkins     come    but  once  a year.*\n\n  One    winter  day  I  saw  my   father's  car  parked   in front of the cafe  where   he  was   eating.  I sat in the  car  until he came   out and   found   me.  He   looked  pretty  good.   He  was chewing   on  a  toothpick,  the  way   he  liked to,  and  started the motor   just to show   me   how   the warm    air came   out  of a heater  under   the dashboard.    What    was  he  doing?  What he was  doing   was  trying  to find  a new   mother   for me.  He did  not  want   me   living  forever   with   a  family  like  the\nMulligans.    He  did  not  say  so, but  I knew   he  was   thinking  that we   were   superior   sort  of people.   That   pleased and  puzzled   me  since he  was  not  a good  provider,   as Mrs.\nMulligan     never   tired  of  saying,   and    I knew    he   ran around   with  loose  women    even   as he  talked  about   a new mother   for me.\n  We   drove   around   for  a while,   then  he  parked   the  car near  32nd   and  Dewey    where   we   could  sitand   talk. That was  new.  He   had  always   been  too  busy  a father,  when   he saw  me,  to  give me   anything    but  money.   I had   come   up in his  eyes,  even  as  he  had  fallen  in  mine.   He   told me that he  had  found   a real new   mother   for  me,  but working itout  would   stilltake  a  littletime.  She  had   her own   nice home,   where   I would   have  a room   in the  basement,   and   a daughter   who    was  crazy   to have  a  younger    brother.  We would   both  go  to the  same   high  school,  to  which   my   fa-\n\n   *\"A  FightBetween a White Boy and a Black Boy inthe Dusk ofa Fall\nAfternoonin Omaha, Nebraska,\" 1970.\n ther would   drive  us on  his  way  to work.   Never   before  had my   father  given   me   a  five-dollar  bill. I  kept   it in  my watch  pocket,   afraid  to spend  it, fearing  the  person  I gave itto  would   ask  me  where    I got it, or  say it was   counterfeit. These    days   I was   having    so  many     adventures    I looked  forward   to telling  somebody    about   them,  but  when the time  came   I didn't,  I don't  know   why.\n   In the  lobby  of the  Gaiety   Theatre   on  Harney,    I saw  a poster  advertising   a hula   dancer.   She  had  flowers   in  her hair  and  wore   a  hula  skirt,  but  there  was   no  mistaking\nGertrude.   Without     her  clothes  she  looked   plumper    than with  them   on. I was   not too  surprised   to see  her  dancing, since she  had   often  danced   the  hula  for  me.  I would   applaud  and   the dog,  Shep,   would   bark.\n  At  the  Gaiety   she  was  accompanied      by two   Hawaiians who   played   guitars.   A  day   or  two  later,  at  the  World\nHerald   Building   on   15th  and  Farnam,     I came   out of  the alley with  my   bundle   of papers   to see  my  father  standing on  the corner.   If I spoke   to him   he  would   give  me   some money,   but  I didn't need   money.   Seeing   him  just standing there  alone  on the  corner,  I felt a little sorry  for him.  His pants  looked   newer   than  the  coat. His  heels  were   so rundown    you  could   see  it when    he  walked    away.    I could have  run   to him   and  given   him   a paper,   since  I  always carried  two  or  three  extras, but  I just  stood  there  looking at him  as  ifhe  was  some   other  boy's  father.  Did  he  sometimes  think  I might   be  some  other   father's son?",

    "full_text": "What sort of thirteen-year-old     boy  was   I? I got  in the\n\nI V   movies  for  six cents  and  looked   about  ten.  Measured on the  door  of the  Mulligan    pantry,   I had  lost a  full inch to Joey  in  height,  but  on  the scale  in the  nurse's  annex    I weighed    exactly   what   a  boy   like  me   was   supposed     to weigh,  78V\u00a3  pounds.\n  My    father   felt that  what   I  needed   was   two   or  three weeks  of  fresh  air in the  country.   His  brother   Harry   had a farm   near  Norfolk.   In  turning   down   the  crates  of Leghorn  chickens   he  had  sent  him,  my   father  feltthat  Harry might   feel some   obligation   to  him.   He   explained   that   I was   now   a  growing     able-bodied    boy,   and   there   were many   chores   I could   do  around    a farm.   I  knew   how   to sort eggs,  and   I could   pick  chickens.   It would   surely   do me  a world   of  good  to get  away   from   the city  for a vacation on  a real  farm.\n\n  Near    the end  of  July  Harry's   wife,  Clara,   wrote   me  to say that  I could  come,   if I had  to, but  with   all she  had  to do  I would   have   to pretty   much    look  after  myself.  That was  all right  with  me,   since  I'd been   doing  that  for some time.  I would    take  the  train  from   Omaha     to Columbus, then  up   from   Columbus     on   the  local  with   the  gasoline motor   to  Warnerville,    where    Uncle    Harry    would    meet me.  One   of the things   I would   learn  was  that  Warnerville had  been   named     after  one  of  my   cousins   by   marriage, who  had   been  born   and  raised  in the  house   that sat in  the grove  of trees  near  the  tracks.\n  When     I got off  the train  in the  late  summer    twilight,  I had   a  fiber  mailing    carton   with    a  change    of  clothes washed   and   ironed  by  Mrs.   Mulligan.    I was  wearing    city clothes  to travel  in, my   cap  still stiff with  the  paper   lining, on  my   feet a  new   pair  of green   leather  shoes  with   a dark  patch   of  leather  on  the  ankles   and   toes.  The   soles were  also  green   and  resisted  bending,    pulling   away   from my   heels  with   each  step   I took.  They    were   so  new   I'd only  worn   them   up  and  down    the  aisle of the  train.\n   Uncle   Harry   was  not  there  to  meet  me   when   I arrived.\n\nI watched    the taillights  of the  coach   go  over  the  horizon, and  when    the  throbbing    of  the  gas  motor   died,   a noise settled around    me   like it was   trapped   in  my   ears.  I had never  heard    anything    like it. On   both   sides  of  the  dirt road  that  led to the  east the  weeds   were   almost  as  high  as my  head.   Fireflies  rose  from  the  dark   fields to hover   like a cloud   of sparklers.   The   night  air  was  heavy   and   sweet with  the  smell  of hay.  As  the  fields  around   me   darkened, the  bowl   of  the  sky  above   me   seemed    to  brighten.   My stiff-soled  shoes  flicked  the  sand   of the  road   to  fall into the heels  of  my   shoes.  In the  overall  drone   of the  sounds around    me   I was   able  to  distinguish   the  cadence    of  the locusts.  It began   slowly,   built to  a climax,   then  tailed  off into  silence.  At   the  rim   of the   eastern   sky  I  could   see stars.  When    I  stopped   in  the  road   to look   around   me   I experienced     a  pleasurable    apprehension.      Big   bugs   and millers  flew  into  my   face. I  sucked   in small   insects  when\n\nI inhaled.    Far  down    the   road,  in  which    I stood   at  the center,  two   small  flickering   lights  came   toward    me.  The putter  of the  motor   rose  and  fell as the  road  tilted upward or declined.   As  the  car  approached     me   a cloud   of insects obscured   the  lights. I had   to move   from   the road   to let the car  pass  me  and   proceed   to a  point  where    the  driver  was able  to turn   it around.   Coming     back   toward   me,   itwent ahead   a few   yards  before   it stopped.   In  the dusky    light I saw   an  erect  dark   figure   gripping   with   both   hands    the vibrating    steering   wheel.    No   feature    of  his  face   was visible.\n   \"So   you  made    it,\"  he  said  to  me,   then  spit  into  the weeds   to the  left of the  road.  What    I said  to  him,  if anything,  I have  forgotten.   \"Climb    in, boy,\"   he  added,   and  I did  as I was   told.\n   The   summer    I met   him,  my   Uncle   Harry    was  a  heavy, dour,   silent man    with   his  family,  but   given  to  deadpan joshing   with  his  neighbors,    his  puckered    lips sealed   and stained   with   tobacco   juice.  After   spitting,   if his  hands were   free,  he  would    pinch   his  pursed    lips  between    his thumb    and  forefinger,   then  give  a twist  as  if tightening   a cap   on  a  bottle.  His   wife,   Clara,   was   a  tall, lath-flat woman     with   a  high-pitched     voice,  who    liked  to  work.\nHer    daughter,     Mae,     away    at  school    that   summer, planned    to teach  school.   Her   son, Will,   had  attended   the aggie  college   in Lincoln    and  farmed    the  adjoining   acres.\n\nHis  house    could   be  seen   through    the  stand   of  catalpa trees along   the  drive-in  from   the  road.  Just  the  year  before,  Will   had   married    a  black-haired     young    woman from  Missouri.    While   I was   on the  farm   she  would   bring over her  baby   and   let itcrawl   around   the  floor  while  she helped  Clara   with   the canning.\n  Harry    and  Clara's   house   was  square,   without   gables,  a lightning  rod  with  a  blue  ball on  it at the  roofs  peak,   the windows     of the   upstairs   bedrooms     almost   flush   to  the floor. I could  lie stretched  out  on  the  floor and   look out.  I had  Will's   old  room,   with  clothes   stored  in  the  dresser, the  curtained   and   screened    window     facing   the  drive-in between    the  two  houses.    In  the  pulsing   flashes  of  heat lightning   I would    see  the  intricate  pattern    of the   glass curtain,  the screen   behind   italive  with  crawling,   clicking, fluttering  insects.  The   cats  howled   and   the  owls   hooted.\nAbout    dawn    I  would    hear   the  gagging     sound   of  the pump,   and  then  the  splash  into  the pail  as Harry    pumped up  the  water.  As  he  approached     the  house,   carrying   two pails, I'd  hear  the  occasional   slurp   of the  water   and   the rub  of  the  denim    between    his  thighs.  Up    the  stairwell from   the  kitchen   would    rise  the  smell   of  the  kerosene spilled on  the  cobs. The   flames  would    whoosh    and  roar  in the  chimney,    then   settle back   to  a  steady   crackle.  The new   day  had   begun,   but  I  would   pretend    to sleep   until\nClara's  shrill  voice cried,  \"Wright,    you  coming?\"     Since  I was  always   coming,   I  never  really  knew   if she  would   call me  twice.\n\n   She  wiped   the table  with  the dish  rag  then  leaned  there, propped    on  her  spread   arms.  A  few   leaves  rattled  in the yard.  Some    dirty  Leghorns     clucked    and   waited   at  the screen.  She  left the  rag  on  the  table and   emptied    the pan toward   the  leaky  shade.  She  stood  there  awhile,   her  hands pressed   into  the  small   of her  back.   Turning,    she  looked down    the  trail bright   now   with   copper   leaves  at  an  old man's   knees,   white   in  the  sun.  She   watched    his  brown hands   liftMonkey      Ward's,   tear  out a  page.   She  watched him   read  both  sides, very  slowly,   then  tip his  head.  As  he rose  his overalls  came   up  with   a sigh  and  one   strap  hung swinging    between   his  legs. She   watched   him   step  into the sun  and   hook   it up.  From    his hat  he  took  a  feather  and passed   it through    the  stem   of  his  pipe,   then  turned    to strike the  match   on  the  door*\n\n   Clara   baked   biscuits, fried  eggs  and   cooked   oatmeal   for breakfast.   The    eggs  were    fried  hard,   in  bacon   fat, the oatmeal   thick   and  chewy    as taffy.  After  sitting  all night, the separated    cream   had   to be  spooned   out  of the  pitcher.\nMy    Uncle   Harry    would    spread   it on   a hot   biscuit  like jam.\n   My    daily  chores   were   to  fetch   water   and   baskets   of cobs.  The   cobs   could   be  seen  pressing    against   the  windows   of the  first small   house   they  had  built  on  the  farm.\nWhen     I stooped    to scoop   them    into  the  basket   I might hear  mice   rustle  the  tassels. Sometimes     I carried  a  mouse into the  house.   I would   see it later, its whiskers   twitching, spying   on  me   over  the  rim  of the  basket.   Clara   set traps for  mice  in  her  cupboards,     but  if I heard   them    go  off I knew    she  hadn't  caught    one.  She  had   little respect  for  a boy  as  old as  I was   who   couldn't  set  a trap.\n   Clara   kept  about   thirty-eight   Plymouth    Rock    chickens,\n\n   * The Inhabitants.\n and  Harry    milked   about   twenty    Jersey   cows.  The    cow pasture  was   at the far north   end  of the farm,   down   a lane of cottonwoods    that  Harry    himself  had   planted.   Nothing\n\nI had  ever  seen  grew   so close  to the  sky. Some   nights   the cows  would   come   into  the barn,  and   other  nights  I would have  to go  after them.   There    was  always   one  cow,   when she  saw  me  coming,    that  would   go  to the  farthest  corner of the  pasture,  where    the weeds   were   high.  In  the  kneehigh  weeds   near   the barn   I had   seen  both  garter   snakes and  sand   vipers. What    to  do?  What    I had  learned   to  do was  run.  Once   I got behind   the  last cow  I would   hoot  and holler like  I was  crazy,  and  once   you  get an  old cow   riled up  she  likes  to  run  with   her  tail up,   like a  whip   in  a stock,  her  udder   swinging.   I'd  let up  running    and   walk once  I reached   the  tree lane,  but  some   of the  cows  would stillbe  mooing   when    they  reached   the barn.   What   was   it they'd  seen?  Uncle   Harry   asked   me.  He   was  also puzzled why   his  cows,   with   such   good  pasture,   were    giving  so littlemilk.   In my   first week   on  the  farm  the  one  thing   I had  learned   was  to  keep  my   own   counsel,  and  my   mouth shut.  The   cows  didn't  much    like me   in the  stable  either, mooing   and   milling  around    when   I came   near  them,   so  I would   just  stand  around   the  stable  door  watching    Harry squirt  milk  right  from  the  teat at  a row   of cats. To  make sure  they  didn't  miss   any,  they  would    rise up  and   let it splash  on  their  fronts, then  lick it off.\n\nIn  the yard   are  the remains    of a croquet   set\u2014four    of the wire  wickets,  a striped  ball, a club,  and  one  bird-spattered end  post.  On  the  barn  the  hayloft  window    is clear and   in the  window    are several  cats\u2014but    the  roof of the  barn  and other  details are  left out. On   the  harrow   the  metal  seat  is drawn   as if copied  from   a photography    but  the seat  itselfis in suspension    and  not  joined   to the frame.   The   corn  crib isblocked   in  very  roughly   and  under   the  lean-to  roof  isa treadle  grindstone.   The   drip  can  suspends    over  the  stone as the  harrow   seat  over  the  harrow,   and   how   the  treadle mechanism     operates   isa  littleobscure.   Beneath    the stone, in a nest  of dirty feathers,   isa  chill white  egg.   The  hedge iscut  flat at  the top  and   extends   the length   of the  driveway,  with   a  break  for  the  trail to  the privy.   There   is a heavy  undergrowth,     and   ithappens     that all we  can  see  of the privy  is the  tin on  the door  and   the curling   leaves  of a catalogue.  . .. The  whole   sketch  is like a peeling   fresco, or even  more   like a jigsaw   puzzle  from   which   the  key  pieces have  been   removed.    One   of  the hardest   pieces   to fit has been  the pump.    It has  twice  been  put  in\u2014and    once   erased out\u2014for   either  the  barn  is much    too close  or the  pump    is much   too far  away.    This  may    have  more   to  do  with  the weight  of a full  pail of water\u2014fetched      water\u2014than      it has with  the  actual   location  of the  pump.     The  only   solution was  to  draw   both  pumps     in, reconsider    the  matter,  and then  take  one  pump    out.  This  he  did,  but the  pump    that he  left was  where    no  sensible  pump     would   be.  And   the one  he   took  out   was   the  pump     in  which    he  couldn't believe. *\n\n   When    I didn't  have  my  chores   to do  I liked  to sitin  the sun,  my   back   against   the   warm    boards   of  the  barn.   I wanted    to look   like  a farmboy,    my    face  and  arms    tan, when    I got  back   to  Omaha.     Compared      to the   noise  at\n\n   *The Man  Who  Was There.\n night,  the day   seemed   to  me  as  quiet  as  a church.    Here and  there   I saw   a  butterfly   zigzagging,    or  grass  stems waggle    when    a  grasshopper     jumped.     Cloud    shadows passed   over  the  scarecrow    in  Clara's   garden,   the  straw sticking  out  of one  of  Harry's    coat  sleeves. It scared   the crows,  but   the  shiny  blackbirds,    with  eyes   like hatpins, perched   on  his shoulders.    If I listened  hard   I could  hear\nUncle   Harry    \"gee\"   and   \"haw\"    his  team   at  the  end  of each  furrow.    He   plowed    with  horses   although    his  son,\nWill,  had   told him   there  was   no  place  for  a  horse  on  a farm.  Harry    had   sent  Will  to  the  aggie  college   in Lincoln, then  refused   to believe  anything   he  had  learned.   He scoffed  at  everything   Will   did  or  said.  Will  was   not  so tall,but   he took   after Clara,   with  her  big  adam's    apple, her  high-pitched    voice  and  unblinking    eyes.  The   way  his adam's   apple   pumped     when    he  swallowed    made    it look like he  had   a  bend   in his  neck.   With   Will's   .22 rifle  I shot  my   firstjackrabbit,   but   when   I  picked   him  up,   his big eyes  wide   open,  I dropped    him   and  ran.\n   The   Sunday   before  I left, the  Morris   and  Warner    familieshad   a big  reunion   at their grove   in Warnerville.    People came   from   as far  as Lincoln,   where   my   father's  sister\nMay    had  married    a  Warner    who    sorted  mail   in one   of the  Union   Pacific  mail  cars.  May    was  my   father's  favorite sister, and   the  happiest   grown-up     person   I  had  ever met.  She   laughed    all the  time   and  liked  everybody.    All the  women    at the  reunion   brought    along  whatever    it was they  cooked   the  best.  We   had   chicken   and  hams,    potato salad  and  cole  slaw, with   everything   else in a white   sauce.\nClara   had   made    berry  pies  the  week   before   and   stored them   in  the storm   cave  until  the  reunion,   wiping   off the mold  with   a cloth  dampened     with  vinegar.   It didn't  work for pies  with  meringue     toppings,   but  it worked    for hers.\nAll I  did  was  chase   my   cousins   in and   out  of the  house until we   were   eaten  up  by  mosquitoes    and   had  to  sit inside. Two    of  my   cousins   from   Lincoln   had   run  around barefoot  and   cut the  skin  between    their toes  on  the sharp sickle grass.   Not  having    lived  on  a farm,   or  brought    in cows   from   the  pasture,    they  didn't   know    about   sickle grass  or very  much    else.\n   When    it was  time  for  me  to  leave  I was  tanned   on  my arms   and   had  freckles   on  my   nose.   In  a pillbox   I  had found  in  the cobhouse    I had   the forked   tongue   of a  sandpiper,  along  with  three  copper   shell  casings  from   the bullets I had   shot  at  the rabbit.   At  the  Warnerville    station\nHarry   asked   me   who   my   father   was   married   to  now.   I said  I didn't  know.    He   didn't  ask  me  to  come   again,  or wait  to see  if the train  came   and   stopped   for me,   but  got his Ford   turned   around,    bucking   in  forward,   then   drove off in a  cloud  of  dust. There    was  no  wind   at  all to move it.When    it finally  settled there  was   nothing   to see.",

    "full_text": "I was     eager   to show   Joey   my   tan and   tell Mrs.   Mulligan  all that  had   happened,    but  my   father   met  me   at the station  and   drove  me   back  to  his apartment     on  Harney.  While   I was   on  the  farm   one  of  his brothers,   from\nZanesville,  Ohio,   had   come  to  pay  him  a  visit. My   Uncle\nVerne   was  a  plump,   red-faced   man   who   had   been  gassed in the  war   and   lived  on  a pension.    His  eyes  might    roll back  so that  they  showed    all whites,  but  itwas   something he  couldn't   help.  At  no  time   did  he  like  his  bald  head uncovered,   and  he  slept on  the  daybed   sitting up,  with   his hat  on. He   nodded    his head   to what   my   father  said,  but he  didn't  talk  himself.  In  the  pocket   of his  vest  he  kept gold  coins  of all sizes that  he  liked  to try  and  balance   on their  edges  when    we  sat  at cafe  counters.   If the  counter was   flat and   smooth    he  could   do   it. While    my   father talked  to  him   about   the egg   and  chicken    business   Verne would   try  to balance   the  coins  on  the  counter.   He   had   a tremor   in his head   that  made   it hard  for  him  to  sip coffee or  light his  cigar,  but   his  right  hand   was   so  steady   he could  stand  the  dime-size   gold  coin  on  its edge.  I couldn't do it myself.   It made   me   nervous   just to try.\n\n   It was   my   father's  idea  that  his  brother   Verne   should be his  partner   in  the  egg  business.   He   didn't  have  much experience,    but   he  had    a  little capital.   That    way   he would   keep   it in  the  family.   There    wasn't   much    to the business   to show   anybody,    and  my   father  found   ithard   to drive  and  talk  business   at  the  same   time.  Once    we  were out  of  Omaha,     away   from    the  cops   and  the   traffic, he would   let  me  drive   while   he  and  Verne    sat  in the  back seat  and   talked.  That    suited   me   fine.  West   of  Omaha there  were  stretches  of  road  that  went  up  and   down   like a roller  coaster.  If I  got  up   to forty-five   miles  an   hour   I could  feel it in the  seat. If I looked   in the  rearview   mirror\n\nI could  see  that  Verne   liked  it, rolling  his  eyes  when   we topped   a good   rise. We   drove   all over  five or  six counties visiting  the  local  egg  dealers   and  creameries.    While    my father   talked   with   the  creamery      man,   Verne    and   me would   have   a piece  of  pie  in a  cafe  or sit on   a bench   in the  park,  if they  had   one.  I  liked  him   better  as  I got  to know   him,  and   he liked  me   better than   eggs  and  chickens.\nWe   had  some   good   times.  If he  sat in  a cafe  with  a  marble counter    he  would    stand  one   of his  gold  coins   on  its edge.  There   were   people  who   hadn't   even  seen  a real  gold coin. After  talking   allday  with   the egg  and   creamery    people my   father  didn't  talk the  egg  business   to Verne   on  the way  home.    He  might    sitin  the  rear  seat, behind   the  side curtains,  while  Verne   would    sitin  the front  seat with   me, his hat  flapping    in the  wind.   What    he  liked  more    than anything   else  was  the  wind   in  his face.  My   father   cared so little who    was  driving   he  might    forget  to  ask  me   to change   places  with  him,   and  I would   drive  in  the dark   to the Harney     Cafeteria,  where    we  could  eat  all we  wanted for thirty-five  cents,  including   dessert.  After  a  long  day's drive, both  Verne   and   me  got  our  money's   worth.\n   With   his lips chapped    and   his face  windburned,     it was all right  with  my   father  if Verne   and   me  went   riding  on our  own.  We   might   go  to Council   Bluffs,  just  to cross the bridge  and  look  at the  muddy    Missouri.    Verne   liked Iowa towns   because   they  had   more   trees  and  benches    in their parks.  When     we   got  home    in  the  evening   there   would always   be grass  in  the cuffs  of his  pants.  Now    that  I was driving  a  car, I thought    itwas   about   time  I was   wearing long  pants,   just  in  case   one  of  the   cops  or  somebodystopped   me.   I  wouldn't    have  much    going   for  me   if he looked  in  and  saw   I was  wearing    knee  pants.\n   In late  August,   just  before  school,  Verne   and   me   were driving  north   of Douglas     Street  when   he  waved    me  over to the curb.  That's   what   he  did  when   he  wanted   to buy   a newspaper.    He   got out  of the  car, then  he  leaned   back  in, said,  \"Here,    kid,\"  and   put   some   coins   in my    hand.   I didn't  see  that they   were   gold  until  he  turned   and  went off. I  couldn't   do  much,    with   the  car  to  think  of,  and watched    him    hurry   away    into  the   Brandeis    store  entrance,  one   hand    holding   his  hat.  I  drove   around    and around   the  block,  but  he  didn't  come   out. I knew    that he didn't  like eggs  or chickens,   and  to tell the  truth  he didn't much    like my   father  or the  women     my  father   introduced him   to. What    he  liked  most   of  all was   a  roller-coaster road  with  the  wind   in his face,  and  then  he  liked  me.\n\n   I had  all this money    but  I knew   better  than  to mention itto my   father,  who   would   try to persuade    me  to invest  it in the egg  and   chicken   business.  I didn't  know   much,    but at least I knew   better  than   that.\n\n  With    Verne    gone,  my   father   turned   his  attention   to\nMrs.  Van   Meer,    the new   mother   he  had   in mind   for me.\nShe  had   been  away   for  part  of  the summer,     visiting  her people  in  Wisconsin,    leaving   her  daughter,   Claudine,    in charge   of  the  house.   Raising    Claudine,    who   had   been something    of a  tomboy,    had   been   a trial  for  Mrs.   Van\nMeer,   and  given  her  a strong  dislike  of children,  especially boys.  My    father  had   explained    to her  that   I was   no longer   a  child.  To   emphasize      that  point   we   went   to\nBrowning     and   King's   and   bought    me   a suit  with   two pairs of  long  pants.\n  We   didn't  want   to surprise   Mrs.   Van   Meer   at  supper, so we  put   off arriving   until almost   dark.  She   was  in  the chain  swing   on  the porch,   behind   the basket   of ferns. My father  didn't  seem    to notice   the  sprinkler   was   running until  he  had  walked    right  through    it. \"Jesuschrist!\"    he said, one  of his  favorite expressions.\n   \"Is that  setting  your   son  a good   example?\"     Mrs.   Van\nMeer   said.\n   My   father   said, \"Come     and  meet   your   new   mother,\"\nand  I walked    around   the  sprinkler   to the  porch,  my   new crepe-soled   shoes  squeaking.    She  stayed  in  the swing,   the streetlight dappling    her  face. I liked the  way  her  braids  of hair  went  around    her  head,  but  her  round   moonface    and wide  lipless mouth    made   me  think  of Happy     Hooligan    in the comics.   My   father  said, \"He's   grown    since I last  saw him.  He'll  soon  be the  biggest  one  in  the family!\"\n  \"I  wish   I  thought   so,\"  Mrs.   Van    Meer   replied,   and looked  through   the  open  window    to the  back  of the  house.\nA short  fat girl and  a  tallyoung   man    were  in the  kitchen, washing    and  drying   dishes.  I  could  hear   the  girl laugh like she  was   being   tickled,  and   I liked   her  laugh.   My father  said  the  way  I  was  growing    up   itwould    be  good for me   to  have  an  older   sister. While    my   father  talked\nMrs.   Van   Meer   looked   at me.   The   wire  basket   of ferns that hung    between   the  posts  had  just  been   watered,   and dripped   on  the  porch   rail. My    father  took   off his  coat, folding  it across  his lap  so  the  lining  and  the  label  were on  the  outside.  When    he  stopped   talking   we  could   hear\nClaudine   giggle  and   laugh.\n\n   I would    have   Claudine's    old  room    in the   basement, with  the  door  at the back   Iwould    have  to keep  locked.  To get  to my   room,   Mrs.   Van   Meer    explained,    I wouldn't come   in the  front  door  and   walk   through   the  house,  but go  around   the  house   to the  door   at the  rear.  My   father would   show    me  where    my   room   was.   The   grass  at  the side of the  house   had  also been   sprinkled,  and   we  got our shoes  wet   walking   through    it.The    basement    was  small, but  had   a smooth   cement    floor and   was  clean   as a  gym.\nClaudine's   old  room   was  large  enough,   but  the  only  window   was   at the back,   up  too high   to look  out  of. On   the wall  she  had  pictures  of dogs   and  movie   stars, and  a map of a  camp   she  went   to in  Wisconsin.    She  had   an  almost new   girl's bicycle  with   a basket   strapped   to  the  handlebars.  There   was   also a  sink  and  a toilet  in the  basement so I wouldn't   have   to run  up  and  down    the stairs.\n\n   I was  about   ready   for bed   when   Claudine    came   down to meet   me  and  saw   how   tanned   my   feet and  arms   were.\nShe  wet  her  finger at  her lips and   rubbed   iton  my   arm  to see if the  tan  rubbed   off. Claudine    was  a  fat girl, with  a face  like  a  kewpie,   and   I  could   tell she   liked  to  fool around.\n   \"Why    can't  we  sleep  together,\"   she  said,  \"since  we're brother   and  sister?\"   She  took   my   hand   in  her  fat  one, said, \"You   like my   mother?   I don't  like her.  I don't blame your  father   for marrying     her  for  her  money.\"    She  gave me  a  quick  peck   on the  lips, said,  \"I've  always   wanted   a brother.  Are   you  going   to protect  me?\"    I couldn't   tell if she  was   joking  or  meant    it. She   felt my   bicep   muscle, said, \"You're    strong,  aren't  you?\"    Was   it my   new   long pants?  From    the top  of the  stairs her  mother   called,  \"Oh,\nClaudine!\"\n   \"She   thinks  we're   down    here   doing   something    dirty.\nYou  want   to?\"\n   My   lips dry,  I shook   my  head.   No,  I didn't  want   to. I was  also at  a loss as to  how   we  might   do it. On  the  stairs we  could  hear  her  mother's   steps, and  we  just  stood  there, almost  but  not  quite  touching,   until she  came   to the  door and  saw  us.  With   a big  squeal   Claudine    gave  me  a  push and  I fell on the  bed.\n  In  the  morning,   washing    dishes,  Mrs.   Van  Meer    asked me  what   I  thought   of  my  father's  business.   Against   her better judgment    she  had  been   persuaded    to invest some   of\nMr.   Van   Meer's    savings  in  it. My   father   made    a very good  impression   on  some   people,  and   was  plainly  smarter than  most   of  them,   but   Mrs.   Van    Meer   was   troubled about  his business   transactions.  He   had  been  in business.\nWhy   should   he need  help  from   her?\n  Only   with   Gertrude   had   I been  talked   to as a  person who   might   know   something    worth    knowing.    Mrs.   Van\nMeer   didn't  seem   to feel  that  my  age   handicapped    me.\nHe  was  my   father.  I had  known    him  all of  fifteen years.\nWe  were   eye  to eye, cleaning   up  after  breakfast,  and  we put all the  dishes  back  into  the cupboard,    the silver back into the  drawer.   I was   pleased  to  be  asked  my   opinion, but  troubled   as  to what    it should   be.  In  the  egg  and chicken  business  my   father did  not seem   to prosper,  smart as he  was.  Just  recently  he  had  found   ithard   to pay  my board   of five dollars   a week.   How    could   I recommend him?  Whose    side was   I on?  Mrs.   Van  Meer    was  a short, plump   woman    of  the sort my   father  described   as dumpy, but  she  was  now   my   new   mother.   She   wore   a net  over her  hair  and   a  bathrobe   that  she  held   gripped   at  her throat. While   talking  to me  she  moved   around   the kitchen wiping   off the counters   with  a damp    rag. Mr.   Van  Meer had  been  dead  for  seven years.  Living   with  Claudine,   she had  grown    accustomed    to talking  with   people   not much older  than  I was.  Claudine   had   encouraged    her to  marry my  father.  \"You   better  do  it while  you   can, Mom,\"     she told her. Mrs.   Van  Meer    had  not personally   feltany  need to do it one  way  or the  other. My   father  had  insisted.  She had  not known    what   to do. And   for a year  now   Claudine had  been   going  with  this young   man   who   worked    at the soda  fountain    in the  Blackstone    Hotel.   His   name   was\nMax    Cohn.   He   was   of  Jewish   extraction.   He   made   a salary  of twelve  dollars  a week.  If Claudine   married    him, as she  planned,   when   she  was   old enough    in November, the  next  thing  she  knew    she  would    bring  him   home    to live in the house.\n  Mrs.   Van   Meer    liked  to walk   around   as  she  talked.  I sat at the  table  in the  kitchen.   Her   voice  would   come   to me  from   the  bathroom,    or  from   the  hallway    where   she was  dusting.   Did  it occur  to  me  that  in marrying    my   father she  had   hoped   to head   off Claudine    marrying    Max\nCohn?   I  recognized   that  she  faced  bewildering    decisions.\n\nIf the advice  I  gave her  was   not  what   she wanted    to hear she would   just not  come   back  from   where   she  had  walked off to. At  first I thought    she  had  gone   to the  bathroom, but that  wasn't   it.\n\n  At  a  gym   class in the  high  school  I stood  in a  long  line waiting  to  have  my  throat   looked  at  and  my   heart  tested, when   I saw   Joey   Mulligan    in the  line  ahead   of me.   He had  grown   at  least an  inch  taller than   I was,  but  he  was still wearing    knee    pants   and   high-top    hook-and-eye shoes.  I wanted    to  speak  to  him,   but  it confused   me   to have  a new   mother,   a  new   home   and  a  sister, with  a  life so different  than   my  old  one.  I watched    him   exercise  for the heart  test, and   saw  his  neck  and  ears  get  red just  the way  they  used  to. There    were  things   he had   of mine   that\n\nI still wanted,    like  the  cigar  box   of  marbles   including agates  and   puries,  and   my   Flexible   Flyer  Junior   Racer under  his  porch.  I missed   the nights   under  the  streetlight, but  if Lillian  knew    I was   wearing    long  pants  when    we played  \"Run    Sheep   Run\"    itwouldn't    be the  same.\n   During   Christmas    vacation   I was   in the Brandeis    store trying  to make   up  my  mind   what   I wanted   for  Christmas, when   I saw  Gertrude,    followed   by my   father,  come  out  of an  elevator.  Her   arms   were   full of  packages.   My    father was   smiling,   his  head   wagging    from    side  to side   with what   he   was   thinking,   and   he   held   her  arm    as  they walked   toward    the  door,  the  unbuckled     tops  of  her  galoshes  flapping.  For  just  as long  as  I stood  there  I hardly knew  just  who,   or where,   I  was.\n  In   January     we   had   a  blizzard    so  bad   Max    Cohn couldn't  get  his  Ford  to  start, and   I went   to school   with\nClaudine   on  the  streetcar.  On  the  way   home   I would   take a transfer  and  go  down   to  11th  Street to  help  my  father.  I might   candle   some   eggs,  or address   postcards    to the  egg and  chicken   dealers   all over  the  state. Sometimes     my   father wouldn't    be there,  the front  door  locked,  and   I would walk  up  Harney    Street  to the  Y  and  play  Ping-Pong    until time  for  supper.    My    father   had   become     so  uncertain about  his  meals,  Mrs.   Van   Meer   had  suggested    he should eat in  restaurants.    Sometimes    I  saw   him   in the  cafe  on\n24th  Street  where    we   both  used   the  same   meal  ticket.  I learned   from   Claudine    that  there  were   nights   he  didn't come   home    at all.  I got  to  like  Max    Cohn    during   the evenings   we  worked    together   on  the  superheterodyne     radio he  was  building.   The   tubes  alone  cost him   five dollars apiece.  At  school   I had   gone  out  for  the  wrestling   team because   itwas   something    I was  pretty  good  at. I made   the team   in the  ninety-five-pound     class. With   my   skinny   legs\n\nI looked  so  littlelike a wrestler   the  coach  said  itproved   to be to my   advantage.    My   opponent,   sizing  me   up  in tights, got overconfident.    I won   all my  matches    up  through   January,  when    I  didn't  feel so  good   in  the  regional   finals.\nThree   or  four  minutes   after  the bout   had  started  the  referee  stopped   it and  called  over  the  coach.   I was  wearing black  tights,  but  on  my   arms    and  chest   I was   speckled with  red  splotches.  My   forehead   was   hot, and   back  in the locker  room   a doctor  told  me  I  had  chicken   pox.  He   gave me  a  ride home   in  his car,  and  I was   in bed  when    Claudine  came    downstairs    and   found   me.   I  guess   I looked pretty  funny,  the  way   she  laughed.   The   five or six  days  I was   in bed   I read   Silas  Marner,     The   Count   of  Monte\nCristo  and    almost   all  of  The   Three    Musketeers,     and wrote  a  report.  I hadn't   seen  my   father  for  more   than  a week.  When     I was  able  to get  around   I went   to his  place of business,   which   was   locked   up  tight,  with   a sheriff's notice  on  the  door.  Someone     had  come   to  take  away   the chickens,   but  otherwise    everything    was   pretty  much    as usual.  One   of my   father's  ledgers   was  open   on  the  desk, with  a  package    of  gingersnaps.     The   coveralls   he  wore when   he   was   picking   chickens   were   on   a  hook   on  the wall.\n  Thanks    to  my  Uncle   Verne,   I had  plenty  of  money,   but ifI  tried to  spend   it,it would   make    people   suspicious.   I might   have  spent   the  night  in  the  lobby  of  the  YMCA, behind   one   of  the  big  chairs   or  couches,    but  when     I thought   about  where    I would   feel safe  I could  only   think of Miss   Healy's   classroom,    on  the  second   floor. When     I cleaned  the  erasers  on  the  fire escape  I sometimes    left the fire escape,  window     unlatched.    That   way    I could   come back  later and   sitat her  desk.  It was   the empty   room   that pleased  me:  the  rows  of  shiny-topped    desks,  the high   bare windows,    the  shadows    of the trees  moving    on  the ceiling.\n\nI often weighed    myself   on the  scales  in the  nurse's  annex, or sat on  the  sheet-covered    couch.\n   Never   before  had   I seen  the  room   at night.  The   lights of the  passing  cars  skipped   from   window    to window     and litup  the  rack  of maps,   the writing   on  the blackboards.    I could  see  the  white   dog   in the   horn  of  the  Victrola.   I could  have  it all  to myself,   but  the  window    was   locked.\nJust  a few  months    before,  I had   been  anxious    to get out of grade  school  and   into high  school,  but  now   I longed   to be back   in my   seat at the  front,  so close  to Miss   Healy   I could  smell  her  perfume    when   she  walked   up   and  down.\nAcross  the  aisle from  me   sat Pauline   Myers,   her  eyes  like a goldfish  when    she  wore   her  glasses. In  the  dark  under the stairs  of Helen   Minor's    house  I had   kissed  her  when we  played   spin the  milk  bottle.  Where    had  Betty   Zabriskie gone  with   her cello?  Or  LaRue    Gator,   who   drew   galloping  horses  ridden   by  cowboys    and  Indians?   Or   Victor\nMusselman's      sister,  Glavina,    who    read  from    Current\nEvents   on  Tuesdays.    I had   given  up  reading    when   confronted  with  the  word   \"catastrophe.\"    Alone   in the  cloakroom   with    Miss   Healy,    she  would    tell  me   what   she expected   of me,  the  smell  of Sen  Sen  on  her  breath.\n   Between    the  passing   cars   the  room   went   dark,   as  if erased  from   the  blackboard.   I  had  shamelessly    bawled   to please  Mrs.   Mulligan    when    she  grieved  for her  son  who had   died  in a  pesthouse,   but   it shamed    me   to cry  real, smarting   tears  for myself.  On   my  tear-filmed   eyes  the approaching   car  lights exploded   like  stars. I thought   I might go to Turner    Park   and  crawl  under   the porch   of the  skate house,   where   whoever    found   me,   even  Mrs.   Van   Meer, might   feel sorry   for me.   I had  become    more   of  a whole orphan    than  a half  one,  and   I huddled   with   my   back  to the  brick   wall  that  glowed    faintly  with   the  chalk   dust where    I slapped   the  erasers.  I still had  the  key  to  Mrs.\n\nVan  Meer's    basement,   warm    with   the heat  from   the  furnace,  and  I could   pretend,   ifshe  asked   me,  that  I didn't know   what   had  happened    to  my  father.  I ran  most  of the way  to keep   warm.    Down    the  street from   her house,   under the  lamp   on  the corner,   I could  see that  Max    Cohn's\nFord  was   parked   at the  front. That   could  only  mean   that\nMax   and   Claudine   had   moved   into my   room.   I was  there on the  corner,  wondering     what   to do  next,  when    a touring car  with  side  curtains  pulled   to the  curb  and   honked at me.  I  didn't  recognize   the  car, a  Big  Six  Studebaker, but  the man   at  the  wheel   was  my   father.  When    I got  in he said,  \"How    you  like it, kid?\"\n  We   drove   back   into town   to  a cafe  on  Farnam     where we  could  eat on  one  of  his meal   tickets. It was  so  late we both  had  breakfast.  To  the  cook  my  father  said  that Omaha was   proving   to be  something   of  a disappointment,     and that he  was  now   looking   for greener   pastures.  And   where isthat?   said the  cook.  My    father  didn't  say, but  he  later explained   that   it was   none   of  the  cook's  business.   He knew   where   they   were,  and   that's where    we  were   going as  soon   as  he  could   settle  a  few  accounts.    We    drove around   for a  while,  just  waiting   for daylight,  then   he let me  drive  just to get  the  feel of it. I drove  to Capitol   Avenue,  where   I  shifted  to second   before   we  came   down    it, the front  blinds  drawn    at the  Mulligan    windows    and   the gas jet  glowing   in  the  hallway.   I wanted    to honk,   but  I didn't. My   father  had  rented   a room   on  South  16th  Street in a building   where   I had   once  delivered  papers,   which   I thought   was  interesting,  but  I didn't  bring  it up.\n   My   father  thought    I was   going  to  school,  but  what   I did  most  of  the  time  was   play  hookey.   I walked    around the streets, the  aisles of the  stores, or  played   Ping-Pong    at the  Y  when    it was   open.   I probably    played    Ping-Pong better than   I did  anything   else. In  baseball   I could  catch, even  when   the  batter  swung    at the  ball,  but  I could  only bounce   it  to second    base.  I  could  wrestle,   but   I didn't really like to, and   I hated  to box.  I could  run   like a rabbit for about   twenty    yards,  then   the  runners    behind   would catch  up   and   go  by   me.   I was   also   good   at  pull-ups, which   I  did  for  twelve   times   in  Miss   Healy's    seventhgrade   class, but   what   I looked   forward    to  was   running the  mile  in  college.  I had   read  about   that  in  a  book   by\nRalph   Henry    Barbour.\n\n   I'd meet  my   father  at the  Harney    Cafeteria   for  supper, ifhe  was   not  busy  with  the  Holly   Sisters.  They   were   not really  sisters, or much    alike, but  in  public  they  had   to be seen  together.   I  could  see  them,    if I wanted    to,  on  the posters  in  the  Shubert    lobby,  or  in  the  alley  behind   the\nShubert    when   their  matinee    performance      was  over.  My father  liked  one   better  than   the other,   but  he  had   to go around    with  both   of them.   Which     one  it was   my   father liked  I never  really  knew.\n   In  McCrory's     dime   store,  on   16th  Street,  I  swiped   a roll of black   tape  without   any   use  for it,just  to swipe   it, and  with   money    to pay  for  it in my   pocket.   I was  out  in the  street  when   this  big  fellow  grabbed    me   by  the  neck, like I was   a rabbit,  and  walked    me  back  through    the store with   my   feet  hardly   touching   the   floor. When     he  went through   my   pockets   he found   I had  money    and  gold  coins.\nWhy    had   I swiped   the  tape?  I didn't  know.    Where    did  I get  the  gold  coins?   He   didn't  believe   me.  He   asked   me again,   then   gave  me   a  hard   slap  with   the  palm    of his hand.  My   eyes  smarted,   but  what   hurt  me   worse  was   the shame   I felt when    I began    to bawl.  He   marched     me  up the  alley to  17th   Street,  then  to  the  corner   of Farnam, where   he  found   a policeman,    who   walked    me   across  the street to the  courthouse    and  up  the  stairs to juvenile  hall.\nSeveral  boys  and  a  girl sat in the  waiting  room,   but  I was led into the  office of an  elderly  woman.    She  smiled   kindly at me.  What    was   the  trouble?   The   policeman    explained what   I had   done,  and   that  my   pockets   were   full of  the money   I had   stolen. She  asked   me  to show   her  the  money\n\nI had,  and   I did. Where    had   I got  the gold  coins?   I told her  my   Uncle   Verne   had   given   them   to me.   Did   I live with  him?    No,  I  lived with   my   father.  And   where    was that?  I wouldn't    tell her.  If I told  her  the  police  would find  him.   Where    was   it  I lived?   she  asked   me,   but  I couldn't   tell her  about   the  Van    Meers,   and   I  was   too ashamed    to mention    the  Mulligans.    I  could  see  she  was puzzled   why   a  boy  like me   would   refuse   to say  where   I lived. I  did  tell her  I was   half  an   orphan,   but  hearing what   I said  so filled  me  with   pity for  myself   I began   to sniffle. She  used   her  handkerchief     to wipe   my   eyes  and nose.  I liked  her.  She  had   the  friendly,  motherly   face  of my  civics  teacher.  You   must   tell me   where   you   live, she said, or  I will  have   to put  you   in  the  reformatory    until your  father  or  your   uncle  inquires   about   you.  I couldn't speak.  What    I wanted    to do  was  put  my   head   in her  lap and  bawl.   I think  she  thought   I would   talk  more   when   I stopped   snuffling,  but   feeling  sorry  for  myself   was   very absorbing.   When     she  called  Miss   Healy,   whose    name   I would   give  her,  and   learned   how   highly   she  thought   of me,  she  would   be surprised.   Before   I told her,  however,   I was  taken,  with   the three  other  boys,  and   driven  to a  big house   on  the   bluffs  overlooking    the  Missouri.    A   high fence  went  around    it,and   there  were   sheds  and  barns   at the back.   My   money    was  taken   from  me,   along  with   my watch   and  knife,  and   I was   given   a pair  of  coveralls  to wear  instead   of my   clothes.  At  supper   I sat beside   a boy who   was  smaller   than  me,  but  older,  his head   too big  for his shoulders.   He  gulped   his food,  then  sat with  his hands in his pockets   blowing   on  a train  wheel   at the front  of his mouth.   He   followed   me  around   but  I couldn't   get him   to talk.\n   We   all slept, maybe    about   thirty  of us,  in a  big room with  a  high   ceiling where    an  overhead    light  burned   all night  long. The   boy  in the  bed  next  to me  cried  out  in his sleep. The   moment    we  got  out in  the yard  after  breakfast, one  of the  boys   wanted   to  fight me.   We   walked   clear  to the  back,  behind   the  barn,   where   manure    was   piled  for fertilizer, and   after he'd   hit me   hard   a  few  times   I got mad    and   wrestled    him   to  the   ground.    Another     boy jumped    me  from   behind,   and   they  both   rubbed   manure on  my  face  and  my  hair.  Then   they  let me  up  and  ran  off together,  maybe    eight  or  ten  of them,   laughing    like  hyenas.  It made   me   wonder    ifwhere    they  had  put  me   was some   sort of  farm   for kids   who   were   crazy.  I didn't   let them   catch  me  alone  again  and   acted  like I was  pals  with the one  with  the  train  wheel.  He   liked to play  horseshoes, which   we  could   do  at one  side  of the  house.  What    if my father  didn't  come   for me?   I wondered.    After  all, nobody knew   where    I was.   I thought    of telling  them   about   the\nMulligans,    but  I  was  too  ashamed     to have   stolen  something.  Clear   at  the  back   of the  farm,   where    the  bluffs dropped   off, there   was  a  hole  in  the  fence  that  one  boy had  crawled   through.   But  what   would   I do if I did?  I had the blue  coveralls  we  all had   to wear,  and  they  had   taken all of my   money.    The   nights  were   cold.  Every   morning the ground   was   white  with   frost.\n  Then    my   father  came   for  me   in the  Big  Six  Studie   I could  see at the  front  parked   in the  driveway,   and  I could hear  his  booming    voice  in  the  hall.  He   took  me   in  his arms  when    he  saw  me,  and  the  cold  air puffed   out of  his coat  the  way   it  did  when    I  had   pneumonia      and   Dr.\nBrown    came   to see  me.  After   I got  my   own   clothes,  we went  to  Brandeis   and  bought    me  a  new  mackinaw     and   a cap  with   ear  muffs.   However     long  I  was   there,  it was really  winter   by   the  time   I got  out.  My    father   never spoke  to me   about   why   I was  there,  and   I never  brought itup.\n  When     I asked   him   where    we  were   going   he  replied,\n\"Chicago,   kid.\"  I don't  know   why,   but  the older  and  bigger I got  the more   he  called me   kid. We   had  two  chickenfried steaks  at the  greasy  spoon   where   he  stillhad  a  good meal   ticket, then   we   drove   across  the  river  into   Iowa.\nSince  it'swhen    you  cross  state  lines you   get into  trouble with  the cops,  I let him   drive.\n\n  If  they  ever  got married,   Max    and   Claudine    probably did it in  Council   Bluffs,  since  being  sixteen  years   of age was  old  enough    in Iowa.   I first really  had  the  feeling  of putting   things   behind    me   when    we   were   out   on  the bridge,  over  the flowing   muddy    water,  and   up  ahead   was\nChicago,   where   my   father  and  I would   begin  a  new   life.",

    "full_text": "In    1925   the   city streets   were   paved,   but   the  country\n    roads   were   dirt  or  gravel.   The   dirt  soon   turned    to mud   when     it rained,   with   the  ruts  as  deep    as  a  car's axles.  If you  got  out  of  the  ruts  the  car  would   skid  into the ditch,  like  itwas   ice. To  get  out  of the  ditch  you   had to walk  to  a farm   and  hire  a farmer   to hitch  up  his  horses and  pull  you  out.  On   the other   hand,   ifthe  road  had  just been   graveled   it  would    soon   chew    up  the   old  tires.  I didn't  know   at  the time   how   far it was   to Chicago,   but  it took  us  about   a  week.   Once    we  crossed   the  Mississippi into Illinois  we  made    pretty  good  time.\n\n   If a tire went   flat, or  you  found   it flat in the  morning, you  had  to jack  up  the  car and   pound   the  rim  and  the  tire off the  wheel.   Some   rims   were   rusted   on,  and  had   never been  off. To   get  the  tire from   the  rim,  in case  you   got it off, you   had  to  have  tire  tools, which    were   parts  of  old springs,  along   with  a  hammer,    screw   drivers  or  anything else handy.   Even   then  you  might   have  to bounce    it,pound itand  jump    on  itto get  the rim   to break   so you  could  pry the  tire off. Inside  the  tire, if it wasn't   chewed   to  pieces, was  a  tube  with  a  slow  or  fast leak  in it. A  fast leak  was better,  because   you  could   hear   it,but  to  see a  slow   leak you  had   to have   a pan   of  water  so  the  leak  would    blow some   bubbles.   The   spot  with   the  leak  had  to  be scraped with  a piece  of  tin like a coconut   shredder    before  you  put the patch   on  it. The   smell  of  the rubber    cement   you  put on  the  patch   made   it almost    worth   the  trouble,  but   not quite. Then    you  had  to  put  itall back   together   again  and pump    it  up,  which    might   take   half  an   hour.   I didn't weigh    enough     to  be  good   with    a  pump.     My    father weighed   enough,    but he  was   not good   at it,and  it left him winded   and   cursing.   He  would    have  to  take  his coat  off, unbutton    his collar,  and  loosen  his  belt. Then    his fingers would   be  so  swollen   and   dirty  he  couldn't   rebutton    his collar. My    own   knuckles    were   so bloody   after  using   the tire irons  I could   hardly   put  my   hands   in  my   pockets.  I don't  mean   to say  it wasn't  worth   all the  trouble,  because arriving  in Chicago,    driving  through    the lights, and   finally coming    out  on   Michigan     Boulevard,    along   the  lakefront, a  street  so wide   I  was   afraid  to cross  it, was   like nothing   that had   ever happened     to me.  I was   driving.  My father  was   asleep   behind   the   side  curtains   in  the  back seat. Only    someone    who    has  done   it  the  way   I did   it, driving  from   Omaha    and   coming   in  after midnight,    going north  on  Michigan     toward    the  Wrigley    Tower,    the  waterworks   building   and   the  Drake   Hotel,   will  understand what  it was  like  to reach  Lincoln   Park   and  know    the lake was  there   and  not  be  able   to see  it,just  hear   the  boats honk.\n  On   one  of the  dead-end    streets we  slept  in the  car until the morning    light  burned   on  the  windshield,    and  when    I raised  my   head   I saw   for  myself   the  world   was   round.\nThe   ore boat  I  was  watching    on  the  far horizon   dropped right behind   it, leaving  nothing   but  smoke.\n  All   morning,    as  we  drove   around,    I  felt my   father's elation.  We   had   breakfast   in  a  Raklios   restaurant    with grapefruit   and   oranges    piled  high   in  the  window.     We watched   a  drawbridge    go  up  like a  street leading   into the sky. This   was  a  city like the  one  I had  seen  on  the  covers of Sears,  Roebuck     catalogues,   with   great  steamers   arriving, trains  departing,   the  streets  thronging   with   cars  and people,  and  I  could  feel it pulsing  around    me  like  a great locomotive   taking   on   water,   the  pistons   faintly  hissing, the boiler  throbbing   with   power.   The  white   building   with the clock  in  the  tower   belonged   to  William    Wrigley,   the chewing   gum    king.\n\nDear   Son\u2014\nHave   moved.   Have    nice little place  of our  own   now,   twoplate  gas.  Warm     sun   in  windows     every  morning,     nice view  ofpark.   Plan   to get  new   console  radio  soon  now,   let you  pick  itout. Plan   to pick  up  car so  we  can  drive  out in country,  get  out in  air. Turning    over  in my   mind   plan   to send  you  to Harvard,    send  you  to Yale.  Saw   robin  in park this morning.    Saw   him  catch  worm.*\n   We  took  a  room   in a rooming    house   near  the Dearborn railroad  station.  We   got  a room    at the  front  so we   could\n\n   *The Works ofLove.\n look  out  the window     and  keep   an  eye  on  the  car. If the out-of-state  people   saw  our   Nebraska    license  they  would stop and   start a conversation    with  me   or my   father.  Very few  of them   came    from  as  far  away   as Omaha.     I met   a house  painter   from  Grand    Island,  Nebraska,    who   said he had  a boy   my  age  he  wanted    me  to meet.   He  took  me   to his room   over  a store,  but  ithad   nothing   in it but  a bed.\nHe  sat  on  the  bed   talking  to  me,  and   I walked    over  to look  out  the open   window.     \"There's   my   father,\"   I said.\n\"I  guess  he's  looking    for me,\"    and  took   off  down   the stairs. My    father  wasn't   there,   but  it was   something    I could  say  to get  out  of a  fix I'd  got  myself  into.  Once   I walked   right  through   the Loop,   clear  to Michigan     Boulevard  where   I could  look  across  the  street at the  art museum,  but  most   of the  time  I sat on  the  benches   or  walked around   in  the  Dearborn     station.  All  day  long   the  train callers called  out  the stations.  High   on  the  wall  were   the big posters  showing    scenes  of  the far  west:  the Garden    of the Gods   in  Colorado,   the  Grand   Canyon    in  Arizona   and\nCatalina   Island   off the  coast  of California.   If my   father asked  me   what   was  on  my   mind,  it was   usually  Catalina\nIsland  but  it might  be  the  Royal   Gorge.\n   When    my  father  found   a  position  with  the  Northwestern  Railroad,   we  moved   from   the  room   on State  Street  to an  apartment     on  Menominee       Street, just  a  block   from\nLincoln   Park.  If I leaned   out  the  window    I could  see  the bare  trees  and  the  streetcars  passing   on  Clark   Street.  At night  we  could  hear   the rumble    of the  ice cracking   up  on the lake.  The   apartment    was  so  big we  had   rooms   to rent out  if we   could  find  someone    who    wanted    to share   the kitchen.  The   delicatessen   store  on  the  floor below   stayed\n\n                                 94                                       ,\n\n                                                                    _i open   until  eleven   o'clock   on  weekends,     but  the   trouble with  that  was   that  the  door   slammed     hard   when   people went   in and   out.  The   newer    buildings   on  the  street,  all painted   the  same   color, were   garages   for  the  cars  of people who    lived over  on  the  Gold   Coast.   From    the  window\n\nI could   watch   the  chauffeurs    wash   and   polish  their  limousines.  Two    of  these  cars  were   so  elegant  they   had  the headlights   in  the  fenders,   and  the  chauffeur    had   to  ride where   the  rain  fell on  him.   Except    for riding   out  in the open,  I thought    the life of  a chauffeur    was  pretty   soft.\n\nTo  get  to Menominee      Street  in  Chicago   you   take  a Clark streetcar  in  the  Loop   and   ride  north,  twenty    minutes    or so, to Lincoln   Park.   If you  want   to get  the feel of the  city, or ifyou   like to see where   it is you're  going,  you  can  stand at the front  of the car  with  the  motorman.     On  certain   days you  might   find   Will   Brady   standing    there.  Not   that  he cared   where   he  was   going,   but  he  liked   the  look  of the street, the  clang   of the  bell, and  the  smell   of the  crushed track  sand   that  came    up  through    the floor.   He   liked  to stand  with   his hands   grasping    the  rail at the  motorman     's back.  At  certain  intersections   he  liked  to turn   and  look\u2014 when   the  door  at the front  stood  open\u2014-down      the  streets to the  east  where    the   world   seemed    to  end.   It didn't,   of course,  but  perhaps    he liked  to think   it might.  On   up  the street he  could   see the  park,  and   in the  winter,   when   the trees  were   bare,  he   could   make   out   the  giant   brooding figure  of  Abraham     Lincoln.    Soft green,   like  the  color  of cheap   Christmas   jewelry,   or  thefine   copper  gutters   on the homes   of the  rich.*\n\n   *The  Worksof Love.\n\n   If I walked    straight  east  through   the  park   I came   out on  the  breakwater    along   the  lake.  A  cinder   bridle  path, shaded   by trees, went   along   Michigan    Boulevard    as far  as\nOak   Street,  where    the   sandy   beach   began.    From    Oak\nStreet  I could  read   the  time  on  the  Wrigley    clock.  Some of the people   who   had  cars on  Menominee      Street  also  had horses  they  rode  on  the  bridle  path  on  Sunday    mornings.\n\n   If I walked    down    Sedgwick    Street,  across  North    Avenue,  I would   be  in the  slums   of Little  Sicily, full of  Italian  boys   as  dark   as  Arabs,   but   if I  walked    up  Clark\nStreet to  the north   itwas   like Omaha     around   24th   Street.\nAt  night,  on  the  lids of my   eyes,  I could   see the  flash  of light when    the trolleys  on  Clark   Street  slipped  the  wires.\n\nI had  first seen  that  in  Omaha,    before   Gertrude    had  left my   father,  but  in  Chicago    I thought    of her  whenever     I saw  a  vaudeville   show.   Every   time  I  saw  a  hula  dancer, which   was  often,  I thought   it might   be  her.\n\n   I seemed   to like  the city better  than   my  father,  who   no longer   enjoyed   working    for  a  railroad.   To   start a  new chicken   and  egg  business   what   he needed    and  didn't  have was  collateral.  Anyone     in Chicago    who   needed    anything at all ran  a want   ad  for  itin  the Sunday    Tribune,    where my   father,  befpre  he  put   his shirt  on,  looked   for people who   were   looking   for him.   My   father   wrote   to them   on the stationery   of the  Barclay   Hotel,   on  Clark  Street,  suggesting  that  they  meet  him   in the  lobby.  I first learned  he had  in mind   sending   me  to  Yale  when   he  said so  to a man who   himself   had  a son  in  Princeton.   These   men   had   collateral,  all right,  but  they   did  not  seem    to see  a  great future  in eggs.\n   Until  I would    go  back  to  school  in  the fall, my   father worried   about  my   idleness. At  my   age,  back  in the  Platte\nValley,  he  was   doing  a  man's   work   and   filling a  man's shoes.  Idleness  was   like an  illness, he  said, in  that  itgot worse  before  it got  better. That   was  something    my   father read  in  the Sunday     Tribune   once   he  had   put  aside  the want  ad  section.  He  liked  to read,  and  might   write  down on a  card  words   or  sayings  that  appealed    to him.   In the want  ads,  where   he  ran  his  own,  big  Chicago    companies advertised   for boys.   A  boy   like  myself   could   get a  job making    twelve  to  fifteen dollars   a week,   which    was   almost  double   what   my   father  had   made   at  my  age.  Boys like me,   now   working    at  these  jobs,  would   one   day  be president  of the  company.    They   knew    the business.   They had  learned   it from   the  ground    up.  My    father  did  not question  my   qualifications,  but  he  was  of uncertain   mind, as I  was,  which    business   I would    one  day   head.  Commonwealth    Edison   appealed    to him,  more   than   itdid  me.\nSamuel   Insull,  a little wrinkled   old  man   whose    picture  I had  seen  in  the  paper,  was   president   of  Commonwealth\nEdison   and  had  his office in the  Loop,   right there  in Chicago. When    we   passed  it on  a streetcar  my  father  pointed itout.  To  get  the  feel of the  business   I would   sometimes eat pie  in the Raklios   restaurant   on  the  firstfloor.\n   The  company     that had   more  appeal   for /ne  was  Montgomery    Ward,   with   whom     I had   had   personal   connections. Part  of the  time  I had   spent  on  my   Uncle   Harry's farm  had   been  inside  mail-order    catalogues,   and  the  section of watches   that  appealed    to me  most  had   been  in the\nMonkey     Ward    catalogue.   Both   the  retail  store  and  the wholesale   warehouse     were   on  Chicago   Avenue,    where   it crossed  the  canal, just  east of the  freight  yards  where    my father  worked.    Every    Sunday    they  ran   an  ad  that  they would   pay   boys  up   to eighteen    dollars  a  week.   I  didn't believe  everything   I read,  or that  my  father   told me,  but  if\n\nI had  to  choose   a company     I wouldn't    mind   being   president  of, itwas   Montgomery      Ward.    My   father  said  to me, and  not  for the  first time,  \"Kid,  it's your  own   life.\"\n   They   paid   me   fifteen  dollars  a  week    to do   what   I'd have  done  for  nothing,   ifthey  had   asked  me,   since I loved to roller skate.  My   job  was  to fill mail  orders  for  shoes  by skating   around    in  the  mail-order    shoe   department.     By early afternoon    my   fingers were   so swollen   I could   hardly make   a fist.My    feet were  light  when   I took  the  skates  off, but  I felt so peculiar   I  could  hardly   walk.   I had  to  walk most   evenings   because    the  Larrabee     streetcars   were   so crowded   I couldn't   get on.  That   firstnight   my  fingers  and feet tingled  so  much    I couldn't  sleep.  After   three  or four days  the tingling   stopped,   and  I'd  skate  up  and  down    the aisles just  because   I enjoyed    it,but  by   evening   I'd be  so tired I'd  have  slept  in  the  stockroom    if they  had   let me.\nOn   Sundays     even   my   father    noticed   how    different   I looked.  My    legs  were   skinnier   than   ever.  I  could   wear collars without    the wings   curling.   I had  the  money    to eat all I wanted,   including   chocolate   malts,  but  I couldn't   eat enough   to  keep  from   losing  weight.   Before   I went  to  bed, which   I did  pretty  early,  practicing   my   harmonica     under the covers,  I would   drink   a pint  of chocolate   milk   and  eat half  a  carton   of  Lorna    Doones.     But   it didn't   help.  I learned  from   the  supervisor,   who   was  from   Pisgah,   Iowa, and  not  too far  from  Omaha,     that small   boys  had  more   of a problem    because   the  skates  were   so heavy.\n   The   supervisor    switched   me   to  the  wrapping     counter on  the  mail-order    chute,   where    everything    came   down from  the  catalogue   department    that  was   small  enough   for people  to carry  and   had  to be  wrapped.    In just a  few  days my  ringers   were   cut  and  sore  from   the  heavy   wrapping twine.   From    there,   where    the  time   went    fast,  I was switched   to a  counter   in the  retail store  where    itseemed hours  and   hours   until lunch.   There   were   times  all I had to do  was   think.  I  worked    with  a  girl  who   would    have been  pretty  except  for  her teeth.  Right  at  the front,  where you  couldn't  miss  it, she had   one  that was   like mother-ofpearl,  and  one  that  was   black.  I liked  to joke  with   girls, as I  did  with   Claudine,    but  if something    struck   her  as funny   she  would   put  her  hand   to  her  mouth,    concealing her teeth.  But  I agreed   with   her that  if she  letthe  dentist pull them   it would   be  worse.\n\n   If the weather    was  good   I would    walk  up   Larrabee    to\nSam's    Cafe   near   Blackhawk      Street.   Death's    Corner, which   I learned  about   later, was  right  there  on  the corner of Larrabee    and   Blackhawk.    As   I walked   up   Larrabee    I could  see  the  flashing   lights of  the  elevated   trains,  near\nNorth   Avenue.    Right   across  the  street  from   Sam's   Cafe was   the  Larrabee    Y.  Through     the  big   windows     at the front  I could  see  the Italian  kids  playing   Ping-Pong,     and hear   the  click  of  billiard   balls  when     the  lobby   door opened.   But  the way   these  boys  hollered  and   yelled scared me.  They    were   all black-haired,    mostly   with  dark   complexions,   and   I  didn't  understand     what   they   yelled   at each  other.  Some    looked  smaller   than   me,  but  they  were all tougher.    If I  entered   the   door  to  the  men's    lobby, where   there   were  chairs   to sit on  and   papers   to  read,  I could  hear  balls  bounce   and  billiard  cues crack   when   they got  into  fights. The   Y   secretary   spent  most   of  his time vaulting   over  the  counter   to  break   up  a  fight, or  chase someone     out  the   door.   As  a  member      of  the  Omaha\nYMCA      in  good   standing,   I had   privileges   at  YMCA's elsewhere,   but  what   good  were  they  if I was  afraid  to  use them?   What    I  wanted   to  do  most   was   play  some   PingPong,  then   have  a long  hot  shower.\n   A cold  day  in November,     just a few  yards   from  the  Y, I saw  this man    stretched  out  on  his face  on  the sidewalk.   I figured  he  was  drunk.    In the  dark  I  could  just make    out the holes,  like buttons,  across  the back   of his coat. He   was sprawled    his length   right  in  front  of  a window     with   a row   of small   holes  in  the  splintered   glass,  about   chest high.  Light   from  a  passing   streetcar  was   enough   for  me to see  that   the  holes   across  the   man's   back   were   not buttons.\n   In  the  Y  lobby    a husky    sandy-haired     man,    with   a whistle  dangling    from  his  neck,  was   behind   the  counter.\nHe  knew   he  hadn't  seen  me   before,  and  in a friendly   way he  asked   me  what    itwas   I  wanted.   I  said  there  was   a man   lying   on  the  sidewalk    out  in  front.  He   asked   me where,   and  I told  him.   He   asked  me   if I had   seen  anything  else, or  ifanyone    had  seen  me,   and  I said  I didn't know.   Cars  had   passed.  He   vaulted  over  the  counter   and took me   by  the arm   to lead  me  to the  stairs at the  back  of the hall,  where   the  warm    draft  of  air smelled   of  swimming  pool  chlorine.   We   went  down    the stairs  to the locker  room,   through    the  locked   door   into   the  shelves   of lockers,  then   clear  to  the  back   where   the   dirty  towels were   piled  into  a  cart. He   emptied    out  about   half  the towels,  told me   to climb   in, then  piled  the  towels  on  top\n\n                                                                    A of me.  Like   we  were  playing   a  game,  he  said,  \"Now    you just lie quiet  here,  you  hear  me?\"    I lay there  for  half an hour  or  more,  maybe    an  hour.  I could  hear  the  splashing in  the  swimming     pool,  and   hear   the  drumming      of the showers.   When    he  finally  came   for  me  my   clothes  were pretty  damp,   so  I had  to  take  them   off and  spread   them on a  radiator.  He  gave  me  a  towel  so I could  take  a shower, and  follow   it up  with   a swim   if I  cared  to. I took   a long  hot  shower    but  I didn't   feel like  a swim.    I stayed down   in the  locker  room  until  the boys'  section  closed, the lobby  lights  went  off, and  the  man   came   down   to get  me.\nHis  name   was   Al Cox.   I told him   my  name,   and   where   I lived on   Menominee      Street.  We   had  a  hot  chocolate   together,  on   North   Avenue,    where   he  explained    that  the man   had  been  shot  by  gangsters,  and   itwas  just  our  good luck  that nobody    had  seen  me.  It was  not  lost on  me  that he  had  said  our.  I was   a member     of  the Y,  but  I  knew that he  meant   to be saying   more  than   that. He  walked    me up  North    Avenue   to  Sedgwick    Street,  where    we  agreed that  I would    see  him   tomorrow,    then   I made    it pretty quick   to Menominee,       where    the  delicatessen   was   still open.  Although     I didn't   really  like it, I  had  a  cake   of\nFleischmann's    yeast  with   my  pint  of milk.\n   The   next  day  I played   Ping-Pong    with   Al  Cox   in the lobby  and  beat  him.   I also beat  the  others  I played   with, including   Emmanuel      Guagliardo,    a boy   so hoarse   voiced he just grunted.   After  losing  to me  three  times  he  stepped on  the Ping-Pong     ball and   broke  the  handle   off the paddle. When    Al  Cox   tried  to catch  him,   he  ran  out  of the door  hooting.   But   later  he  came   back.   While    I played\nPing-Pong    with   one  of the  others   he  sat in  the  window watching.   He   was  not  so bad-looking    when    he was   quiet, except   for  his  harelip.  Just   before   the  lobby   closed   I played  him   again,  and   when   I beat  him   he  ran  off hooting, but  he  didn't  break  the  paddle   or  step on  the  ball. I walked   with   Al   Cox   to  the  elevated   station,  where   he asked  me   how   long  I  had  been   in Chicago    and   where   I was  from.  We   shared   a  nut  Hershey    while  he  waited   for his train,  and  he  said  that  most  of  the boys   in the  lobby were  real  Eye-talians,    from  the  old  country,   who   didn't speak  English    unless  they  had   to, and  they  were   not  accustomed   to  a boy  from   the west,  like  me.  While   I had   a good  time  for  myself   in the  lobby,  I  could  also  be  doing good  for  others   by  the  way   I  talked,  the  way   I  played\nPing-Pong,    and  the  way  I didn't  step on  the  ball or  break the handle    off the  paddles.   We   shook   hands.   He   said  I should  call him   Al, not  Mr.   Cox.\n\n  I wouldn't    be president   of the  company    right  away,  but with  the money    I was   making   I could   afford  to wait.  Not having  to  wait  for  my   father  to give  me   money   on   Sunday, I had  all day  to myself.   \"Kid,\"   he would   say,  \"where you  off to?\"\n   \"The   Bible  Sunday    Club,\"   I would   reply.  He   couldn't object to  my  interest  in the  Bible,  after  all that had   happened   to me.   The   Bible   Club   met   Sunday    mornings    at the Y,  in  one  of the  rooms   on  the men's   side  where   they showed   movies.   The   boys'  lobby   was   closed  on  Sundays, but  members     of the  Bible   Club   in  good   standing   could play  cue-ro-quet    or  Ping-Pong     for  half  an   hour   or  so after the  meeting.\n\n   I liked  to play   Ping-Pong     at the  Y  so  much    I would grab  some   cupcakes    in the  delicatessen   and   eat  them   in the Y  lobby   in order   to save  time.  On   Saturdays    I could play  all day,  with  time   for a  shower   and   a swim    in the evening,  but  on  weekdays    I had  to  hustle  to get in  a couple hours.   There   were   more   and  more   kids  who    wanted to play  when    they   saw  what    the  game   was   really  like.\nEmmanuel      Guagliardo     stopped   breaking    paddles    when he got  it through   his head   that  that  kept  him   from  playing. He  learned   fast, ifhe  could  keep  his  mouth   shut,  and when   he  played   with  me  he  was   a different   person.  Mr.\nWard   Shults,   the Y  secretary,   took  me   back  to  his office so we  could  discuss  it. Until  I came   to the  Y,  Guagliardo had  been  the  terror of the  lobby,  throwing    balls, breaking cues, cursing   and   starting  fights.  He   had  stopped    all of that when    it got through    his head   that  it kept  him   from being  with  me,   and  playing   Ping-Pong.    It was   as  simple as that.  Mr.   Shults  didn't  want   to make    too  much   of  it, but  my   being  in  the  lobby,  and   the  way  I  played   PingPong,  had  made    itpossible   for many   of  the boys,  not  just\nGuagliardo,    to  see  the  light.  Boys   did   not  learn   from rules, but  from  examples,    and  it was   part  of my  example that  Guagliardo     could  not   beat  me   at  Ping-Pong.    The other  parjt was  that  they  had  no  idea  what   made   me  tick.\nThey'd   never  before   seen  a white-faced    boy  like  me  who didn't  raid  slot machines,    curse,   use  dirty  language,    or swipe  the  bar  soap  in the  shower   room.  In  his three  years at  Larrabee    Y\u2014Mr.      Shults   had   come    from   the  Y   in\nOberlin,   Ohio\u2014he     had   never  seen  the  lobby   so peaceful as  it was   with   Guagliardo     quiet.  Something     about   me seemed   to awe   him.  If I would   come   to the  Y  three  evenings  a week,  plus  Saturday    afternoon   and  the  Bible  Club on Sunday,    Mr.  Shults   would   pay  me  five dollars  a  week with  the  promise    of  quick  advancement      in Y   work.   In that  regard  he  wanted    to  advise  me   to get  on  with   my schooling.  A  boy   without   a high   school  education   would soon  find  himself   handicapped     wherever     he  turned.   Al\nCox,  whom     I knew    and  admired,    had   delayed   his own advancement     several years  by  postponing    his college  education. He   was   now   in his  last year  at  the Y   college  on the South   Side.  A  young   man   like myself,  fresh  from   the west, should   avail  myself  of the  best  that a  city like Chicago  provided.   In  that regard,   my   work   at Montgomery\nWard,   good  as  itwas,  was   not enough.   The   Y  was   fortunate  in having   a group   of young   men,   all from  Lakeview\nHigh   School,   who   came   down    from   the  North   Side   on\nThursday    evening,   played   basketball,   had  a  swim,   then met  for a club  meeting   with   Mr.   Shults.  They   were  boys like me,  my  own   age. They   were   clean-cut  American    boys like those  I would   have  known    in Omaha.\n\n  I  wanted    to meet   those   boys,  but   if I went   back   to school  I would    lose my   new   independence.     I had   put  a deposit  on  a  pair  of  shoe   skates  I saw   in  a  pawnshop window    and  planned   to give  to myself  for  Christmas.   If I stopped   making   money    I would   be  back  looking   for it in my  father's  pockets.  I had  time  to think  about   itsince  the new   school  semester    did  not  begin   until  January,    and once  the weather    turned   really cold  the  lobby  filled with kids who   were   not  Y  members.    They   saw  the  lights, and came  in  off the streets  to get out  of the cold.\n  One   of  these boys  was   Frankie   Scire,  who   had  stunted his growth   by  smoking   cigarettes.  He  was   small  and  thin, with  eyes  like  saucers   in  his pale   face. He   spoke   in  a voice so  low   and  hoarse   I'd  have  to  sit with   him   in the men's   cloakroom    to  hear   him.   He   told  me   he  went   to\nCalifornia   in  the  winters   and   sold  newspapers     in  Long\nBeach.   He   rode  out  in freight  cars.  I didn't  believe  him, but  that's what    he  said. Frankie    Scire  was   a year   or  so older  than  I was,   and  weighed    about   eighty  pounds   with his clothes  on.  I weighed    him.   I never   saw  him   with  his clothes  off. I liked  to sit in  the  cloakroom    and   talk with him  while   he  leaned  against   the  radiator.  I can't  explain it. He   was   like  a  hoarse-voiced      little girl.  He   never seemed   to lack  for  money,   which    he told  me   he got  raiding slot machines    in  elevated  stations.  Coins   weighted   the pockets   of  his  coat.  He   inhaled    his  cigarettes  so  deep smoke   kept  coming    from   his lips  as he  talked.  I  got so  I liked  Frankie   Scire,  and  he  didn't  seem   to mind    my  trying to  reform   him.  He   called  me  Morse.    He   couldn't  believe anybody    had  a name    like Wright.    He  didn't  seem   to care  for  Ping-Pong,    billiards  or  checkers,   and  once   he'd got  himself   warm    he  would   just  take  off,  I never   knew where.\n\n   Two    weeks   before   Christmas     I was   moved    from   the retail-store  wrapping    counter   to  work   for Santa   Claus   in the  toy department.     My   job  was   to sit under    the  throne he  sat on  and   blow  up   the balloons   he  passed   out  to the kids  sitting on  his lap.  Who   would    think  blowing   up  balloons  would    be  such   hard   work?    It was   hot  under    his throne,  and   blowing   all the  time  made   me   dizzy.  I would still be  warm    and  sweaty    inside  my   clothes  when    I left the  store.\n   A  few  days  before   Christmas,    while   I was   standing   in\n\n                                                                   , the  lobby,  Mr.    Shults   asked   me   how   I  was   feeling.  I wasn't  feeling  so  good.  He   took  my   temperature    back   in his office, then  said  he  thought   I should   spend   the  night at the Y.  They   had  a  room   I could  sleep  in in the  dormitory. It pleased   me  to  be really  living  in the  Y  in  a nice warm   room   near  the  gymnasium,     where    I could  hear  the yelling and  the  thump    of the basketball   on  the backboard.\nAl  Cox   brought   me   a bowl   of  soup  in  the  evening,   and the next  thing  I  remember    was   Mr.   Shults  wishing   me   a happy   New    Year.   I'd  been   sick  with  the   flu for  more than  a week.   My    father  had  stopped   by  to  see me   but  I remembered     nothing   about  it. Istayed  in  bed  two  or three days  more,  coming   down    on  the Sunday    after New    Year's to help  Mr.  Shults   with  the Bible  Sunday    Club.  When    he called on  me   to pray,  I stood  up  and   prayed.  I had   never prayed  in  public  before,  but it seemed   to come   easy  to me.\n\nI thanked    the  Lord   for saving   my   life,and   for the  new friends  I had,  for the  beautiful   winter  day,  and   for other blessings.  Nobody     had   known    I  knew    how   to  pray   so well. Where    had  I learned?   All  I remembered     was   kneeling and  praying   as  a child. Anna    had  been  there  combing her  hair,  and  I  prayed   for both   her  and  my   father,  not forgetting  to ask  the  Lord  to take  my   soul  ifI died  in my sleep. Praying   the  way   I did was   a surprise  to  me  as well as Mr.   Shults.\n\nInside  the room   was  a small  gas  plate  on a  marble-topped washstand,    a cracked    china  bowl,   a table,  two  chairs,  a chest of drawers,   an armless   rocker,  an  imitation  fireplace and  an  iron  frame   bed.  Over   the fireplace   was  a  mirror showing   the  head  of the  bed  and  the yellow   folding  doors.\n\nThe  bed  was  in the  shape  of a shallow  pan   with  a pouring spout  at  one  side,  and  beneath    this spout,  as  if poured there, a frazzled   hole in  the rug. *\n  My    unexpected    talent for prayer   may  have  changed    my life.I  was  sixteen   years  of  age  that  January,    and   Mr.\nShults  felt that a  young   man   of my   talents should   not  be wasting   them   in the  employ    of  Montgomery      Ward.    He could  not  match   their  salary  for  the  time  being,   but  he could  assure  me  more   rapid   advancement     and  time  to resume   my  high   school  education.   The   high  school   for me to go  to would   be  Lakeview,    where   I would    be with   the young   men   I would   have   met  if I hadn't   taken   sick just before  Christmas.   Three   of them   came   to see me  at the  Y,\nMaurie    Johnson,     Gene    Logsdon     and   Orville    Clark.\nMaurie    Johnson's    father  owned    the  Johnson    Dairy    on\nAshland    Avenue,   just  south   of  Lakeview     High   School.\nOrville  Clark   was   majoring   in  engineering    and  planned to go  to Purdue,   where    his brother   was   a student.  Gene\nLogsdon    was   young   enough    to  be  in  the  boys'  department,  but  I  had  often  seen  him   in the  men's   side  of the lobby  reading   the  magazines     and   playing  billiards  with the  men.   If he  had  been   married    it wouldn't   have   surprised  me.  He   dressed   like a man,   and   brought   his  gym clothes  to the Y  in  a satchel  with  the  Northwestern     University insignia.  His   father  was  a  doctor,  and  he  came  to the  Y  in one  of his  father's  cars. That   didn't  give  him  a big  head  or  anything,   even  though   he  was  the  captain   of the  Lakeview    swim   team.  They    came   to see me   at the  Y\n\n   *The Works ofLove.\n just to  persuade    me   to go  to  Lakeview     with   them.   The only  stickler was,   as Mr.   Shults   pointed  out,  that  I didn't live anywhere     close  to the  Lakeview     area.  My    area  was\nWaller   High   School,   one  of the  lousiest  in the  whole   city.\n\nIt was   possible,  however,    in  such  a  big  city, and   having friends  who   lived  so close  to Lakeview     High   School,   that\n\nI could   go ahead    and  enroll  in  the  school,  giving  Orville\nClark's   or  Maurie    Johnson's    address.   Mrs.   Clark   knew people   at the  school,  and  if they  called  her  up  she  would say  that  I  lived  with   Orville.   If  worse   came    to worst, which    it probably    wouldn't,    I  could   live with    Maurie\nJohnson    and   his  brothers   until  the   enrollment    business was   settled.  They   had   rooms    at  the  top  of  their  house nobody   had   ever used.  Mr.   Shults   did not  want   to conceal the  fact that  this  was   somewhat     unethical    behavior,   but he  felt itjustified  in terms   of my   future   and  the  need  we all felt to be  together.  Was   I  agreeable?   Mr.   Shults   felt I should   firstdiscuss   itwith   my   father, who    had  impressed him  as  a reasonable    man   with   my  interests  at  heart.\n\n   It pretty  much    bowled    me   over  to  have   so many    fine people   interested  in  my   future.  I said   I'd discuss  it with my  father   and  let them   know,    but  the  truth  was   I didn't even  mention    it to  him,  fearing   he  might    come   up  with something    against  it. I'd just tell him   I was   going  back  to school,  and  that  would   be  it.\n   Orville  Clark   planned    to  be  an  engineer,   Gene    Logsdon  a  doctor,  like  his  father,  Maurie    Johnson    would    be an  accountant    keeping    the  books    for his  father's   dairy.\nWhat    did  I plan  to do?   I had  no  idea.  Mr.   Shults   saw  a future  for me   in the YMCA.      As  soon  as  I had  high  school behind   me   I  would   enroll   in the  Y   college,  and   hold  a position  on the  side, like Al  Cox.  In  talks with   Mr.  Shults he had  explained    that the  YMCA      was  a  branch   of Christian  service,  to  which   many    were    called  but  few   were chosen.  His  feeling  was   that  I was  chosen.   Boys  just  naturally  looked   up  to  me,  even   those  who    didn't  like me.\nTheir  dislike  for me   was  envy   of my   Christian   character.\nThey   brought    me   money    they   had  swiped    to  divvy   up among    them,   knowing    that  I wouldn't    take  a  cut, but   I had  later heard   them   howling   with   laughter   because   they thought   me  such  a fool. When     I prayed  I could   hear  them snickering.\n  Until   I knew   better  what   I planned   to be,  the thing  for me  to  do  was  take   the  cinch  courses,   like the  history  of art. These    afternoon   courses    counted   for  double   credit, and  the  time   was  passed    fooling  around    and  looking   at lantern  slides. Mrs.   Josephare    taught   this course,  a shawl wrapped    about   her shoulders    as she  stood  at the  window, not troubling   to turn  and  look  at us  while  she  talked.  Her pince-nez   glasses  (was  the  pince  for pinch?)   dangled    on a silken  cord  at her  front  and  left a  deep  purple   bruise   on the bridge   of her  nose.  When    she  asked   for a  boy  to run the magic    lantern,  I raised  my   hand.   I had   learned   how to run   the  one  at  the  Y,  showing    pictures   of  the  Holy\nLand   on  Sundays.   Being   in charge   of the slides, as  well as the  lantern,  I might    stay after  class  to  put  things  away.\nMrs.   Josephare     liked  to relax   a  moment     in the  empty room.  On   one  side  the windows     glared  with   light, but  on the  others  the  walls  were   hung    with  pictures   of  Greece and  Rome.    Plaster  busts  were  on  pedestals   near  the  door, with   one  of  Rodin's   Hands     on  her  desk.   She  had   met\nRodin   in  Paris,  where,    to her   dismay,   his  interest  had proved  to  be  in more   than   marble,   but  she  thought   him an  artist  of genius.   It  may   have   been  the   first time  I heard  the  name   pronounced.\n  After  school  I took  the  North   Side  elevated  train  to the\nLarrabee    Y. On    the  twenty-minute     ride  I  usually  read my  next   assignment    in a  big  thick  book,  Literature   and\n\nLife. We   began  with   Beowulf    and  Sir Thomas     Malory.    I understood   little of what   I read,  but  I  was  captivated   by\nSir Gawain    and   the  Green   Knight,   and   memorized    passages  while  I  was  working    in the  cloakroom.    I only  saw my  new   friends  in the halls  at school,  or on  the Thursday evenings   they  came   to  the  Y  for  a club   meeting.   Every day  of  the  week   I  played   Ping-Pong     with   Guagliardo.\nNothing   baffled  him   more   than  my   going  back   to school.\nHe   had   thought   me   peculiar   from   the  first, but  going back  to school   proved   I was  crazy.  He   was   not  at a  loss for words   in Italian,  and  I was   not  at a loss  for what   he was   saying.  Not   that   he  didn't  like  me.   He   was   also growing   faster  than  I  was  and   had  a  part-time  job  on  a pie truck.   When    he  had   a  shower   and   slicked  his  hair back,  you   could  see  how   much    he  looked   like Rudolph\nValentino.   The   problem    I had   on  my   hands,   busy   as  I was,  was  that  I couldn't  let him   beat  me  at  Ping-Pong.    I knew   that if he beat  me  my   rule would   be  over. Sooner   or later he  would   beat  me,  because  he  was  good,  and   he had me  to teach  him   all the  fine points.  When    we  were   playing  he  wanted    to win   so  bad  I  didn't  think  it was   the\nChristian   thing  to beat  him.  So  why   did I do  it? The   day he  beat  me  I  would   know    if I was   really cut  out  for  Y work.\n   My   friends  at the  Y  had   names   like Domiano,     Trombatore,  Cavaretta,   Scire,  Giusi   and  LaMonica.      The   LaMonica    brothers  were   pretty  well  off, and  came   to  the Y wearing   ties and   rubbers   on  their shoes.  Vito   LaMonica had  a birthmark     on  his face,  but  his skin  was   so dark   it hardly  mattered.    His  older  brother   Johnny    was   working hard  to be  like  me,  Al  Cox   and  Mr.   Shults.  He   came   to the Bible   Sunday    Club   every  Sunday,    acted  as  treasurer and  secretary,   and   helped   put   away   the  folding   chairs.\nSometimes    he  prayed   aloud   without    being  asked.   Guagliardo hated   Johnny    LaMonica     so much    he snarled   when he saw   him,  curling  his  lip back.\n  One    Sunday    in  March     I  had   a  bad   toothache    and stayed  home.    In  the  rotogravure    section   of  the  Sunday\nTribune    I  saw  this  drawing     of a  wolf   with   his  fangs showing.   I had   never  seen  anything    finer. Using   paper   I had  bought   for  my   art history  notebook,    I sat  down   and made   a copy  of  it,using  one  of my   father's  indelible  pencils.What    I had   done  impressed    both  my   father  and  me.\nThe   next  day   at school   I showed    it to  Mrs.   Josephare, who   said, \"Well,   well,  what   have  we   here!\"  After  school\n\nI showed   it to Mr.   Shults,  who   said  he had   no idea  I had such  talents.  The   Y  lobby   needed   posters.  Why    didn't  I plan  to  do  them?   He   would    supply   me  with   the  paper, the  poster  colors,  the  brushes,   and   give  me   seventy-five cents  for each  finished  poster.\n   On  the  front page   of the Daily   News   I saw   this cartoon drawing   of Calvin   Coolidge.   The   likeness  was  not  a copy, but  itwas   wonderful.    How   was   it done?   In such  a  way   I fellunder   the  spell of art. Little it mattered   that  I showed littletalent  for  it. This  fever,  which   did  not  abate,   persuaded   me   that  I was   destined   to be  an  artist, with   my drawings   on  the front  pages  of  newspapers.    I made   drawings in my   classes, in the  study  periods,  on  my  way   to and from   school,   in  the  cloakroom     at  the  Y   on  Saturday nights.  I filled my   notebooks    with   sketches  of  my   classmates.  A   great  commitment      fueled   my   purpose.   In  the basement    of  the  Newberry      Library    on  Clark    Street  I found  back   issues of  newspapers    and   magazines.    My   fingers  were   black  with   India   ink,  the  sleeves  of my   coat embedded    with   art gum.   A  pen  and   ink drawing    of mine of Abraham      Lincoln   appeared    in  the high   school  paper on  his birthday.   The   lobby   of  the  Y  hung   with   posters promoting    moral   virtues. Just   in time  to plan   for the  future it seemed   obvious   that  I was  an  artist\u2014among      other things.  Mr.  Shults  saw   no conflict  between   this talent  and the Christian   work   to  which   I was  called.  Quite   the contrary.  Guagliardo's     admiration,     noticeably    weakening, had  been   restored.   The   Bible   Sunday    Club   attendance, always   diminished    in  the  spring,  was   steady.   At  school\nMrs.  Josephare    referred  me   to Miss   Roth,  head  of the  art department,    as a student   at that  point  in his  career  when special   guidance    would    be  most    fruitful.  With    Miss\nRoth's  permission    and   encouragement,     I  would   major   in art.\n\nTo  get from   the stove  to the sink  it was  better  to drop  the leaf on  the  table and   then  lean  forward    over  the  back  of the  rocking   chair.  On   the shelf  over  the  sink  were   four plates, three  cups  and  one  saucer,  a glass  sugar   bowl,  two metal  forks, and   one  bone-handled    spoon.   On  the  mantelpiece  was  a  shaving   mug   with  the  word   sweetheart       in silver, blue, chipped   red,  and  gold. In  the  mug   were  three buttons,  a  roller-skate   key,  a needle   with  a  burned   point for  opening    pimples,   an   Omaha     streetcar   token,  and   a medal   for  buying   Buster   Brown    shoes.  At  the  back  of the room   were  folding   doors  that  would   not  quite  close *\n\n   Over   the  summer    I worked    all day  at  the Y,  except   for the  month    I spent   at the  boys'   summer    camp    in  Michigan.  I had  fifteen  Larrabee    boys,  only  one  of whom,    Peter\nDeutsch,    had  ever  seen  a  cow  or  been  out  in  the country.\nThere    were   no  cows   where    we   were.   It was   all  woods that  came   right down    to the  edge  of the  lake, a mist  rising off  the  water   when    we   took   our   dips  in  the  morning.\nNone    of  them   had   ever  heard   an  owl   hooting    at night, and   they  were   frightened    by  the  darkness.   I would    have to  beam   a  flashlight  on   the  ceiling  and  tell them    stories until  they  fell asleep.  Two    of the  boys  wet   their beds   every  night.  Back   on  Larrabee    Street, however,    they  all said they   had  had   the  time   of their  lives, and   most   of  them, including    me,  had  ringworm.     Ringworm      starts  like a  little pimple,   then  grows   in a  circle and  takes  weeks   to cure.\n\nI  had   it in my   right  eyebrow,    which    made    it harder   to see,  but it also  took  longer  to cure.  The   two  Scarlatti  boys brought    the   ringworm     home    to  their  five  brothers   and\n\n sisters, and  some   relations   living  with  them,   so  they  still\n had  itaround    at Christmas.    It was  silly to tell them   not to\n use the  same   towel,  and  stuff  like that.\n\n    I felt I'd lost  so much    time   over  the  summer     I signed\n up  for a correspondence      course  in drawing    in order   to get\n the  free drawing     kit they   would   send   me.  To   save  time\n\n    *The Works ofLove.\n between   lessons,  I delivered  my   drawings   to the  school  on\nSouth   Wabash     Avenue.    It  was   not  much    of  a  school.\nThree   or four  people   sat around   a  big table,  and  I could tellthey  were  surprised   to see  me.  One  of  them  explained to me   that  a  correspondence     course   was   by  correspondence.  In  less  than  a  month    I went   through    what   was supposed   to have  been   a six-month    course.\n  One    Sunday    in Lincoln    Park   I  had  been   at  the  zoo drawing   polar   bears.  On  my   way   home   I  saw  this  small crowd  of  people  gathered   around   the  statue  of Lincoln.   A woman     wearing    a  Veil, with   several  elderly   men,   was placing  a wreath   of flowers   at the foot of  the statue.  Some\nBoy  Scouts   with  flags stood  in  the court  at the  front, and to watch   what   was   happening     I joined   them.   After  she had  placed    the  wreath    she  turned   to  the  row   of  Boy\nScouts  and   gave  each  of  them   a  kiss, including   me.  Not until I saw  the  picture  in the  rotogravure   did  I know   that\n\nI had  been  kissed  by  Queen    Marie   of Rumania.     Nothing like that would    have  ever happened     to me  in Omaha.\n   My   father  didn't   expect  me   to  be  home   on  Sundays, since  I was   either  at  the  Y  or  off somewhere     drawing.\nOne   Sunday     Maurie    Johnson,     with   his  father's   new\nBuick,  brought    his brothers   to the  Bible  Sunday    Club   so we  could  all go  to a movie   in the  Loop   later. On   the way we   stopped   by   where    I  lived,' so  I could   change    my clothes. I ran   up  the stairs  into the  bedroom    at the  front, to see my   father, his  back  to me,  seated  on  a chair  with  a girl in his  lap. Her   name    v/as Hilda.   She  worked    in the\nGerman     restaurant   on  Sedgwick    Street.  Her   unblinking eyes, her  head  bobbing,    stared  into mine   over  my  father's shoulder.   Her  head   continued   to  bob, my   father  hoarsely breathing,   as if unable   to stop  the  machine    he  had  started. I ran  back  down   the  stairs,got  into the  car, and  we  all drove  around   in Maurie's    father's  new   Buick   until it was time  for  the  first  matinee.    If we   liked  the   vaudeville, which   we  usually  did,  we  would   stay  and  see  ittwice.\n\n  I  knew    from   experience    about   men   and   women,    but from  the air  I breathed   I had  acquired   my  own   standards.\nMr.  Mulligan    had   been  the  firstto instruct  me   in morals.\nOn  a  spring  day  in Omaha,     seated  in the  Mulligan    yard, he  had  spelled  out  the  distinction   between    pure  women, like  Mrs.    Mulligan,     and   the  loose   women     on   lower\nDouglas    Street, who   lured  men   and   Western    Union   messenger  boys  into  evil. The   air around   crackled   with   these revelations.  Later   Joey   and   I walked    together,   hand   in hand,   up  Capitol   Avenue    and   north  to  Creighton,    until the  fever  of our  initiation  had   cooled.  Joey's   eyes  sparkled.  The   blond  fuzz   stood  clear  on  his burning    cheeks.\nEggnogs     were   waiting    for  us  on   our  return,   'but  we gulped   them    in silence,  easy   on  the  nutmeg,    brimming over  with  the awe   and  wonder    we  felt for Mrs.   Mulligan.\nCorseted   and   queenly,  a  flush  at her  throat,  she  sat erect on  the daybed,   her  short  legs extended    toward   us, the  gas hissing  in the  mantle   as we   waited  for  the spell  to pass.\n   My   father's  practice  deepened    what  was   prudish   in my nature,  a  vein that  ran  deep.  I was   shocked   by  the  use of words   I knew    well,  and  embarrassed     by  the  talk  among my   friends  of things   I knew   better  than  they   did. Under the  racket   of the   elevated  trains   I had   witnessed    gang shags  on  YMCA      mats.  Whatever     else I was,  or  might  be,\n\nI  was  not  one   of them.    This  had   the  effect  among    the boys   at the   Y  of  enhancing    my   baffling   character   and\n\n                                                                    a reputation.   I often  watched,   after  the  Bible  Club  meeting, the  crap   games   held  on  the  steps  of  the  Y,  but  my   role was   that  of an  umpire.   They    would   give  me  money    they feared  to  be caught   with.\n   In  the  lobby,  however,   where    I had  to  keep  order,  if I grabbed    the  wrong    kid  because   I didn't  know    better\u2014\nTrombatore      or a  Domiano\u2014a       gang   of  older  boys  might be  back  later  and  break   most  of the  windows     at the  front of the  building.   Or  they   would   march    through   the  lobby to the  locker   room   and  empty    all of  the lockers   into  the pool.  There   was  nothing   to do  but  clean  out  the pool,  and try not  to grab   the wrong    kid  in the  lobby.\n\nWell,   that  was  how    it was,  and   if it sometimes    seemed strange   it was   hardly   any   stranger   than   anything    else, and  not  so strange   as the fact  that  he only  felt at home   in hotel  lobbies. . .. He  liked  to sit in  a big  armchair    at the front\u2014in     a  leather-covered    chair,   if they  happened      to have   one\u2014and      under   a  leafy potted   palm,   in  case  they had  that.  He   liked a  good   view  of the  cigar  counter,  and the  desk.   He   liked   the  sound    of the   keys   when    they dropped    on  the  counter,   the sound   of  the  mail  dropping into  the slots, and  the  sound   of the dice\u2014though      he never gambled\u2014in       the leather  cup.   God   knows   why,   but  there was   something    he  liked about   it. Hearing    that sound,   he immediately    felt at home.*\n\n   In  the  fall I saw   more   of my   new   school   friends,  Bill\nMiller,   Orville   Clark,   Gene   Logsdon,    and   the  Johnson brothers,   and   in  the   big  Johnson     house,   behind   their\n\n   *The  Worksof Love.\n dairy  on Ashland,    there  were   always  three  or  four  bottles of milk  and  boxes   of cornflakes   on  the kitchen   table. One of the  few  English   words   Mrs.   Johnson    knew,   and   liked to use, was  eat. \"Eat!   Eat!\"  she  would   say to me,   pointing at the table,  since in her  opinion   I was  too  skinny.  Maurie's younger   brother,   Clarey,   had   legs like  stilts,but   he was  short   in the  waist.   He   had   dropped    out  of school, which   he  didn't like, and   helped   his mother    in the  house and   with   the  cooking.   Maurie's     older   brother,   Andy, should  have   been  a  girl: when   he  put  on   a woman's     hat he  looked   like  the  movie    star  Anna    Q.   Nilsson.   Mr.\nJohnson   let Maurie    drive  his  new   Buick   because   the city trafficmade    him  nervous.   He   had  injured  his  hand  in  the bottling  machinery     and   often   had   trouble   in trying   to work   the gearshift.  On   Sundays    ifMaurie    had   use  of the car we  would   all drive  to a show   where   the  audience   sang along  with  the  organ.  There    were  so  many   good   songs  to sing we   might  take  in  another   show   in the  evening.   Back at Maurie's    house,  if his  parents   were  in  bed,  we  would call up   one  of  their  nearby   neighbors    and   say  that  the\nLight  and   Power    people  were   calling.  Would    they  go  to the  window    and   see if the  lights  were   on  in  the  street?\nWhen    Mr.   Steiger,  or  his wife,  came   to  the  window    we would   be laughing   so  hard  we  could  hardly   stand  it.Only\n\nBill  Miller    could   keep   from    laughing    when     he  put through   a  call; the  rest of  us would    be  stretched   out  on the floor,  a pillow   over  our  heads  to  keep  from   snorting.\nRight    when    we   were    getting   even    better   ideas   we stopped.\n   My   art teacher,  Miss   Roth,   might  have  been   the model for the  Rossetti  paintings   on  several  of our  lantern  slides.\n\nHer  crown   of  golden  hair  often  glowed   like a halo.  When she leaned   over  my  shoulder,   or took  my   pencil  to make   a correction,   my   heart   pounded.     Her    health   was   frail.\nWrapped     up   in her   shawls,   warming     her  hands   at  the heater,  she  looked   like  a  beautiful   child. She   had   done illustrations  for art  magazines,    and  owned    a  drawing    by\nJames   Montgomery       Flagg   which   we   were   free  to study for pen   technique.   I was   torn  between    my  plans   to be  a great  cartoonist  and   my   desire  to illustrate  the  stories in the  Saturday   Evening     Post.  At  no  time   did  it cross  my mind   to paint  such  pictures   as I saw   on  the slides  or collected to  paste  in  my   notebooks.   They    came   with  museums,   and  were   created   by  people   different  than   myself.\nMy   art history  notebook    contained   almost   a hundred    pictures,  each  mounted     on   a  sheet  of  colored   paper.   The\nMan    with  the  Golden   Helmet    was   my   favorite  painting.\nMy   favorite  sculpture   was   Rodin's    The  Kiss,  but   I had more   sense  than  to admit   it.In  my   imagination    I saw  his hand   move   slowly   up  her   side to  her  breast,  but   something  always   happened    before  it reached   its destination.  I was  seventeen   years  of  age, and   fuzz  was  growing    on  my upper   lip.\n\nIf the  night   was   warm    his father   would   walk   past   the mossgreen    statue  of Abraham     Lincoln,   then  on  across  the tennis  courts  with   their  sagging   nets  and   blurred   chalk lines. There   would    be  men   with  their  shoes  off padding around   in  the grass.   There   might   be  women    with   white arms  in  the shadows,   fussing  with  their  hair. Under   sheets of newspaper,     with  what   was  left of the  food, some   child would   lie asleep. If there  was  a  moon,   or a cool  breeze  off the  lake, he   would   walk   through    the  park   to the  water3 where   he  would   stroll along  the  pilings  or  under   the trees on  the  bridle path.   In  the  dusk   there  would   be  lights  on the  Wrigley    Tower,   an  airplane   beacon   would    sweep   the sky, and   at Oak   Street beach   people   would   be  lying  in the warm   sand.   The  drinking   fountain   would   give  offa  strong chlorine  smell.  He   would   wet  hisface  at  thefountain,    then take  his  seat  among    those  people    who   had   come    to the beach   but  didn't  care   to take  off  their  clothes:  who   had been   hot  in  their   rooms,   and   perhaps     lonely   in  their minds.   In  the  dark   they   could  speak    what   they  had   on their minds    without   troubling   about  theirfaces,   the  sound of their  voices,  or who   their  neighbor    was.   He   was  their neighbor.   He   sat with  his  coat folded   in his lap,  his shirtsleeves  rolled*\n\n   Although    not   back  on   his  feet in  the  manner     he  had hoped,   with   collateral  to  start  up  his  own    business,   my father  was   sorting   freight   waybills   at  night  in  order   to have  more   daytime   to work    for himself.   I would   often  just be  getting  out  of bed  at  the time   he was   ready   to get  into it. He  would    drape   his  pants   on  the  seat of  a  chair  and hang   his shirt  and   tie on  the bedpost.   In  Chicago    he  had stopped   wearing    the high   stiffcollars  and   wore  those   that came   with   the  shirt, like  I did.  In  a pinch   I  could  wear his shirts  if I turned   back  the  sleeves.  He  ate  breakfast   in his  underwear,      his  pants   unbuttoned,     sitting   straddlelegged   on the  edge   of his chair   as he  poured   canned    milk into  his  coffee.  If  the  green   holes   were   plugged    up  he\n\n   *The  Works ofLove.\n would   open  them   with   one  prong  of  a fork.  The  smell  of the canned   milk   in the coffee  almost   made   me  sick. I was also getting  critical of the talk  about  his plans  for  himself, and  his plans   for me.  His  plans  for  me  always   included  a new  mother.   I didn't  want   a new   mother,   and  I wasn't  so sure  I wanted   to live in  the country,   or go  to Yale.  When he  read  to me   the  want   ads  for  men   who   were   wanted, none  of  them   remotely   suggested   my   father. Who    did  he think   he  was?    He   seemed    to  think   he  was    whoever seemed   to be  wanted.   He  was   a kind  man,   and  I think  he really  liked  me,   but  I  was   repelled   by  his  ways   with women.    How    did he  ever think   a man   like himself   would find a  new   mother   for  me?   I experienced    scorn.  Did  my lip curl in  the manner    of Guagliardo     when   he  saw  Johnny  LaMonica?      I was  determined    not  to work   for  my   father,  and   I looked    forward    to not   living  with   him.   I wanted    to go  my   own    way.   I did  not  like  the  way   he joshed  and  ogled  waitresses,  or  turned  in the  street to look at passing   women.    I did  that  myself,  of  course,  just as  I was  not  superior   to sitting in the  darkened    bathroom,   the blind  raised,  to watch    a shapely   neighbor,   in  silhouette, step  from  the  tub  to dry  herself  with   a towel,  or  put  up her  hair. With    my  elevated   moral  standards    my  own   behavior   was  not  a  problem.    No   woman     had  yet  seduced me,  although    my   hopes   were   rising.  I  had   littleor  no suspicion   that my   true feelings  were   precisely  those that  I would   learn  to conceal.\n\n   Most   of that  summer    I spent  in  northern   Michigan,    at\nCamp     Martin    Johnson.     Martin    Johnson     was   an  old white-haired    man   who   lived in the  woods   by  himself,  like\n\nThoreau.    He  had   given  all of his property   to  the YMCA so that city boys   would   know   what   itwas   like to live with nature.  In  my   cabin   I  had  boys   who   were   experienced with  camping,    and  near  the  end  of the  summer    about   ten of us made    a long  canoe   trip on  the  Little  Manistee.   We had  to  canoe   in  some   really  fast  water,   and  spend    the nights  in the  open,  righting  mosquitoes.    When    we   had  to portage   the  canoes,   which   was   often,  mosquitoes    would settle in a swarm    between    our  shoulder   blades,  where   we couldn't  reach  them.   I had  never   been  in real  wild  woods before,  or lived on  nothing   but  fig newtons    and  river  water. The  trip  was  marred    for me   by the  way   my  companion liked  to  talk  about  girls  while   he  was  paddling.    He couldn't  seem   to get  girls off his  mind,   even  out  there  in the woods.   What    he  wanted   to do  was   get a girl  he knew all alone  in the  woods,   in his  canoe.  Suppose    it was  your own   sister?  I  asked   him.  Who     would   ever  go  camping with  his  sister?  he  replied.   At  the  end   of the  summer, when   the  medals   were   awarded,    I  couldn't  bring   myself to vote for  him,  but  he  won   one  anyhow.\n   When    I came   back  from   camp,   where   the air  had  been clean, and   I had  drunk   the  water   right  out of  the river,  I found  a  pair of silk stockings   on  the hook   in the bathroom and  I could  smell  perfume    on  my  pillow.  I put  my   clothes into the  camp   duffel  bag  and  moved    to the  Y. I felt great, but  itwas  a  dumb   thing  to  do. I had  to live on  ten  dollars a  week,   including    carfare    and   weekend     movies.    Mr.\nShults  called  to my  attention   that the  neighborhood     newspaper   was   running    a  contest  for  the  best  cartoon   on  a political subject.  The   prize   was  twenty-five   dollars,  with publication   in  the  paper.   The   only  stipulation   was   that the cartoonist   had   to  live in  the  local area.   I submitted about  two  dozen   cartoons   that  Mr.   Shults  considered   real prizewinners.     About    a  month    later  they   awarded     the prize  to a cartoon   so dumb    Mr.   Shults   complained    about it.They   told  him   that  I had  been   the  firstchoice   for the prize,  but  when    they   tried  to get  in  touch   with   me   at home   they   couldn't.  Nobody     answered    the  phone.    They concluded    that  I lived  somewhere      else  and  had   entered the contest   illegally. What    stunned    me  was   to have   been both  a  winner   and   a loser  in  such  a  whimsical    manner.\nIn  spite  of my   experience,    I  had   never  questioned    that this world    was   good   enough    as  it was,   if not  the  best possible.  Could   rewards    for the  effort be  so fickle?  Up   to this point  nothing   had  diminished    the  abundant    optimism of my    nature,   or  led  me   to  question   the   confidence    I brought   to  my   enthusiasms.    This   did\u2014but     I  lacked  the time  to sulk. My    sense  of loss was  too  complex   to explain, and  for  the first time   I grasped   that  I needed   a  companion I did  not  have.  In a moment     so unusual    I would   never forget  it\u2014thinking     that  I was   taking   a girl  to the  movies\u2014my     father  said  to me,   \"Kid,   a good   girl can   be the best friend   a boy  ever  had.\"\n\n   I hadn't   known    that. It  astonished   me   to learn  that  at one  time  in his  lifemy   father  had.",

    "full_text": "One       Sunday   morning,    to  my   amazement,     my   father\n       appeared    in the  lobby  of the  Larrabee    Y. His   new topcoat  hung    open   to reveal   a new    dark  suit.  He   had stopped  to  chat with   Mr.   Shults  at the  counter,  and   Mr.\nShults  was   favorably   impressed.    My   father   was  a  good talker, and   he  looked   pretty  good  when    he  was   dressed up. Joshingly    he  explained   that  he  had  come   to  see me, since  it seemed   that  I  lacked  the  time   to see  him.   Mr.\nShults  apologized    for me,  but   said that  my   father's  loss was  the  Y's  gain,  and  he  was   certain  I  had  a  future  in\nChristian   service. He   also  welcomed    the  chance   to speak to my   father  about   me,   which   he  did  while   I played   a littlePing-Pong.\n   My   father  had   a few   words   with  me   privately   as we sat under  a  lamp  at the  back  of the lobby.  When    he  wrote me  a letter he  referred  to me  as \"son,\"   but  when   he spoke to me   he  usually   said  \"kid,\"   unless  I  was   being  introduced   to a  woman.    Personally,   I  liked  \"son,\"  since  that was  what   I  was,  and   the  word   \"kid\"   applied   to  almost anybody.   On   the other   hand,  when    he called  me   \"son\"  it was  usually  because   he  wanted   something.    \"Son,\"   he said to me,  \"your   dad's been   thinking   we  need  a  new  start.\"  I figured   that  meant    a  new   woman     in  our   lives, which would   explain  the  new   outfit he  was  wearing.\n\n  \"I've  got my   work   here,\"  I said, to head  him   off, but he replied,  \"Don't    jump    to  conclusions.\"    We    both   knew what  those  conclusions    were.\n   \"What    I plan,  kid,\"  he  said, \"is  a new   start  for us  in\nCalifornia.\"   That   surprised   me.   All  I knew   about   California  I  had  learned   from   the  posters   in  the  Dearborn railroad  station  lobby,  but  ithad   been  enough.   He   talked some   more   about   how   much    he  disliked  the  heat  of the summers,    which    was   soon   followed   by  the   cold  of the winters,  and  why   should   anybody    put  up  with  that  when there  was   a  place   like  California    to  go  to?   I hadn't thought   much    about  it, but  I began    to. I saw   myself  on the glass-bottomed    boat  sailing  to Mr.   Wrigley's   Catalina\nIsland,  where   the  Cubs   did  their  spring   training.  When did he  plan  to go?  I asked   him.\n  That    was   where   he  wanted    my   opinion,   and   it may have  been  the  first time  he  ever  asked  it. In  the want   ad section, under   \"Personals,\"    he  had  seen  travel opportunities offered   by  people   who    were   driving   to California.\nThe  owner    of the car  would   share  expenses   with   the person, or  persons,   who   went  along   with  him.   What   sort  of people,  my   father   asked   me,  did  I  think   I would    enjoy traveling  with?\n\n  I hadn't   given  it much   thought,   but  it pleased   me  to be consulted.  Even   my   father  had  learned   that  I was  the  one who   knew   about   cars,  and  could   change   tires. On   South\nState  Street,  when   we   arrived   in Chicago,    I  had  seen   a battered   old  touring   car  with   tire  casings   roped   to the front and   rear  bumpers,    cans  for gas  and  oil in  a rack  on the running    board,   canvas   water   bags   between   the  hood and   the  fenders,   the  cracked    windshield    smeared     with rusty  water  from   the  radiator,  and  the  whole   car,  including the  dashboard,    under   a film of  dust  so thick  you  could write  in  it,which    was  what   somebody     had   done.  Across the rear  end   was  fingerprinted    California     or  bust.   If I was  driving   that  car  I would   need   a  pair  of goggles   and would   wear  my   cap  backwards,    with  the  brim   at the rear.\n   Wouldn't    it depend    on  the  car?  I  said. That    too was my  father's  opinion.   The   larger  the  car, for  example,   the more   passengers    there  would    be  to  share   expenses.   He regretted  not  knowing    about   this  form  of  travel when    we drove  from   Omaha     to Chicago.    How    soon,  he  asked   me, would   I feel free  to start?\n   Was   I able  to conceal  my   excitement?    I imagined    what it might   be  like  to drive   across  real  deserts,  and   snowcovered  mountains.     I would   go to  school  later, in  California!  I had   seen   college   movies   of  suntanned     boys   and girls, in a shimmer    of  happiness,   driving  around    in sports cars.  I was   all ready   to  go  immediately,     but  my   father thought   I should   finish the  semester   of school   Ihad   started. We   would    also need   time  to  buy  a  car and   make   the necessary   arrangements.     What    did I  think,  he  asked  me, of this?\n\n                Driving    Southern   California.\n                Seek   congenial  passengers\n\n                to share  expenses.    Warm\n                southern   route  all the  way.\n\n   I recognized    the  cryptic  shorthand     style as  that  of  a railroad  agent  and  telegraph   operator.   My   father  felt that he should   run  the ad  before  we  bought   the  car. If a larger number    of  travelers  responded,    we'd  want    a bigger   car, and  have  more   money    to buy  it. He  had   given  the project considerable   thought.   Each   passenger   would   be  limited  to one  bag,  and  ladies, if present,   should  be  with  their  husbands.   After   our   experience    with    the  Studebaker     he wanted   my   advice   about   the  best  tires. I  wanted    Kelly\nSpringfields,   but  I knew    we  would    get what    came   with the car.\n  On   Sunday    afternoons,   in the lobby   of the  Barclay  Hotelon  Clark   Street, my   father would    meet  with  the  people who   had  responded    to his  ad  in the  \"Personals\"    column.\nOne  of them   proved   to be  a plainclothes   policeman    checking  on  men   who    used   want   ads  to  seduce   women.    He wanted   to  know   where    my   father  came   from,   where   he lived, and  where   he  worked.   My    father  had  to bring   him back  to our  apartment    so  he  could  meet  me.   I was  working on  a cartoon   for the  high  school  paper,   and  he  pulled up  a chair   to watch   me.  He   couldn't   figure  out  a shady character   like my   father  with   a boy   like me.   My   father gave  our  previous   address  as  Central   City,  where   he  had been  a station  agent  and  run  a  big chicken   business,  since any  address   in Omaha     would   show    the police  were   looking for  him.  They    might   be looking   for  me,  if they  knew\n\nI'd been  put  in  a reformatory    for  stealing  something.\n  My    father  was  so  certain  the  policeman    would   be  back we  put  our  traveling  clothes  into  one  bag   and  moved   into a housekeeping     room   on  Shelby.   What    we  would    do, my father  said, would   be  to get us  a car  and  then  pick  up  the passengers   later.  Chicago    wasn't   the only   town   that  was full of people   who   would   rather   live in California.   Right down   the  road  a piece  was   St. Louis,   and  just west   of St.\nLouis   there   was   Kansas    City,  a  town    a  lot of  people would   like to get  away   from.  But   my  father  would    like to see it,just  in case  he  liked  itbetter  than   Omaha.\n   In  a  garage   on  North    Clark    Street,  mostly   used   for storage,  my   father  stumbled    on just  the car  we  needed.   A pair  of  old ladies   had  owned     it,one   of whom     had   just died,  and   the  garageman     was   selling   it for  the  storage costs. The   rubber   was  like  new.  It hadn't   been   out of  the garage   for more   than   two  years.   I liked  the  Essex   coach to look  at, with   its plush   upholstery,   but  there   was  only room   for about   four  people,  including    us. My   father   said that when    two  people   of the  right class, or  three  people   if they  were  smaller,   saw  we   were  driving   all the way   in an\nEssex   coach  they  wouldn't    hesitate  to share   the expenses.\nWould    it run?  The   garageman      said we   were   free to take it for a  drive  around    the  block.  The   motor   turned   right over  when    I kicked  the  starter.  If she  smoked    a  little,as she  did, that  was   due  to  the long   period  of  time  she  had just sat there  and   not run  much.    I drove  about  a  half mile north,  then   came   back   through    the  park.   I thought    she steered   a little hard   on   the  turns,  but   that  might   have been   because   the  tires  were   low.  On   the   radiator   cap  a thermometer     registered    the  temperature     of the  water,   in case  it got  hot.   She  ran   pretty   smooth.    I liked   driving around   in  such  a  tight little box.\n   \"Kid,\"   my   father  said,  \"how   you   like it?\"\n\n   I said  I liked  itfine.\n   My   father   signed   the  papers   and   gave  the  garageman\n$125  in  cash.  He   gave  us, gratis,  five gallons  of gas.  With the  free  gas  we  took   a  spin  through    the  park,   the  bare trees already   looking   pretty  much    like  winter.  There    was ice building   up  on  the  pilings  along   the lakefront.   \"What are  we   waiting    for!\"  my   father   said,   and   slapped    his hands   together.   We   still had   four  days   of  paid-up    rent, but  my   father  had   lost his  feeling  that  his  future  was   in\nChicago.   In  no  way   had  it lived  up  to his  expectations.   If\n\nI thought   about   it,which    I took  time  to do,  it was  Chicago  that  had   given   me   the  expectations    that   I was   now looking    up  to\u2014but      it was   easy   for   me,   if given   the chance,   to shift them   over  to  California.   I would   just  feel stronger  what    I had  been   feeling  all the  time.\n   Coming    back   to a  place  you   like can  be  nice,  as  I had felt coming   back   to Omaha     from   the  farm,  but  taking   off for California,   with   the  first snow   falling,  is like nothing else.\n  As   the   motor   warmed     up   and   began    to  run   a  little loose, I  could  feel  this dull  knock   through    the  gas  pedal, even  before   I  heard   it. It more    or  less stopped    when    I gave  it the  gas,  or we   were   pulling   up  a  long  grade.   I'd heard   that  crooked   car  dealers   would    put  sawdust    in an engine   to  take   up  the   slack  and    keep   a  bearing    from knocking,   but  I hadn't   heard   what   could  be  done  about   it.\n\n  Long    drives  nearly  always   made    my  father  sleepy,   and he dozed   off  before  we   reached   Joliet.  Near    Springfield the road   curved   between    farm   buildings   that  sit so close to itsedge   I could  see in  the windows.     Then   we  crossed   a bridge,  the  water  black   beneath   it, with  a  big tilted barn dark  against   the snow   with   a deep   purple   shadow    beside it.Nothing    special. Just   something    I would   never  forget.\n\n   In  1927   most   of  the   highways    led   to the   center   of towns,  then   out again.   When    we  stopped   at  the lights,  in\n\nSpringfield,   the people   standing   on  the  corner  could   hear the loud  knock   of our  motor.   So could   my  father.  \"What's that, kid?\"   he  said.  I  thought   it might    be  a connecting rod. I didn't  know    what   connecting    rods  connected,   but  I didn't  want  to mention    the  word   \"bearing.\"   I knew   about bearings.   They    called  for  a  motor   overhaul.    When     we stopped   for oil my   father  asked   the mechanic    if he  would like to buy   a car.\n   \"This   one?\"   he asked.\n   We   nodded.   He   listened to  the knock.\n   \"That   bearing's   burned   out,\"  he  said.\n   My   father  said,  \"Make    me   an offer.\"\n   He   put  his  head   in  to  look  at  the  plush   upholstery.\n\"Sixty  dollars,\"   he said.\n   My    father   said,   \"I  paid    more    than   that   for  the rubber.\"\n   He   said, \"Take    itor  leave it.\"\n   \"Kid,\"   my   father  said, \"should   we   take  it?\"\n   \"Sure,\"   I replied.\n   We   had   supper   in  a cafe  the  mechanic    recommended, where   we   sat on  stools at  the counter.   We   had   lost sixtyfive dollars  on the  deal,  but  my  father  had   gone  up  in my estimation.   He  took  a  large  supply   of toothpicks   from  the glass when    he  paid  the cashier.\n  We   took   a bus  to  St. Louis,  where    we  saved  money    by taking  a night   bus  to Kansas    City. The   first thing  we  did was  go  to  the  Kansas   City   Star  and   put  in the  same   ad we  had   run  in  Chicago.   As   he  looked   through   the  want ads my   father  asked   me  what   I thought   of a  1921  Big  Six\nStudebaker.\n   \"How    much?\"    I asked   him.\n   \"One   sixty-five,\"  he  said.\n   \"Not   bad,\"  I replied.\n  One    thing  it would    do  would    be  to take   at least  five passengers.   At   twenty-five   dollars   apiece  that  would    almost  pay   for the  car.  Like  the  Essex   coach,   it sat at  the back  of  a  garage,   but  it hadn't   been   owned    by  two   old ladies.  The   man    who   owned     it had   turned   it  in on   a\nMaxwell     Coupe.   The   tires were   not  so good   for a  trip to\nCalifornia,   but  ithad   a full set of  side curtains.\n   \"Should   we   risk it, kid?\"  my   father  asked   me.\n   \"Sure,\"   I said.\n\n   I put   the  curtains   on  the  car,  and   parked   across   the street  from   the   hotel's  steam-heated      lobby.   From    our room   at  the front  we   could   keep  an  eye   on  it.The    first person   we  met,   but  not  the  first to  sign  up,  was   a onelegged  Greek    actor  going  to  the  Passion   Play  in Los   Angeles.  The   part   he  was   in  was   waiting   for  him   to  get there.  He  wore   the empty    leg of his  pants  pinned   up,  and spent  most   of the  day   in a  chair  in the  lobby   waiting   to see  if anybody    signed   up.  He   also  felt he  should   go  for less, since  with  just one  leg  he  took  up  less room.\n\n   Mr.   Griffin,   from   Akron,    Ohio,   was   on   his  way   to meet   his wife,   Nora,   in  Pasadena.     He   was   a  soft-shoe dancer,  no  taller  than  I  was,  wearing    a checkered    suit, a tight fitting  cap  and  patent   leather   oxfords.  He   liked  me all right, but   he didn't   get along   with   Mr.   Dorfmann,     a gambler    from   New    Orleans,    who   sat  and   played   cards with  himself.   We   had   a woman     who   would    go  as  far as\nSan  Bernardino     if she  could   ride  up  front  with   me,  if  I was   driving,  but   besides  two   suitcases   she  had   a  roped army   locker.  If itturned   out  we  didn't  have   a full car  she could   go  along,   but   we   had   seven   passengers.     Three would   sit in the  front, and   my   father  would   sit on  a suitcase  between    the foldaway    seats  in  the  rear.  We   put  the bags  in  the racks   on  the  running    boards,  or  between    the engine  hood   and   the fenders.   I'd got  to be  pretty  friendly with  the  people   in the  lobby,   but  the  hotel  manager    was glad  to see us  leave.\n   Kansas    City  is  on  a  bluff  overlooking     the  Missouri, with  a  pretty   steep  drop   to  the  bridge,   and  to  save  the brakes  on  this  grade   I put  the  car in  second   gear  to slow it. Halfway    down    the   slope,  without    any   warning,    the whole   gear  box  dropped    right  into the  street. Between    the legs of  Mr.  Griffin,  who    was  sitting  beside  me,  there  was this big  hole in  the floor. Since   we  were  on  a  grade  I let it coast  into  a  garage   just   off the   road.  Several   people    I don't  remember     at all took  their  bags  off  the car  and  just walked   away.   Those    who   didn't  just  sat in  the car  while my   father  made   a  deal  to swap   the  Studebaker,    just  as it was,  for  a  1919   Buick   touring   with   a California    top.  It was   a smaller   car,  and  not  much    to look   at with   its low hood   and  bicycle-size   wheels,   but  it had  an  original-type gearshift.  Sitting  there  in  the  garage,   it ran   like a  top.\nThe  four  people   left crowded    the seats  a bit, but  they  all appreciated   the  California   top. I was   so preoccupied    with the gearshift   I hardly  got  more   than  a glance   at the  Missouri, which   looked   about   the same   between    the banks   of snow   as it did in  Omaha.\n  About    two   weeks   later,  early  in  January,    my   father and  me   and  a  young   man    named    Don   arrived   in Albuquerque,   New    Mexico.   We   still had  the  Buick,   but  none of the   passengers.    In   the  railroad   station,   where    we passed  the  time   and  discussed   with   Don   what   we   might do next,  there  were   Indians   waiting   for  the trains  to  sell their blankets   and   pottery.  If I didn't  dream    it up,  some of the streetcars  had   women    motormen     and  conductors.   It had  been  a  long journey.   I  had  grown   accustomed     to seeing strange   things.   Back   in Gallup    the  one-legged    actor had  said goodbye    to me  in  a bus  station.  Out  in the  street the car  was   buried   in a foot  of snow.   Don    had  been   the one  who  helped   me  get  it started, and  having   nothing   else to do  had  driven   along  with   us, all of us  sitting  in front.\nHe  happened     to  be passing   through    Gallup   at  the  same time  we  were,  on  his  way   to Long   Beach   from   Amarillo.\nHe  showed    me   how   to cut  the  bead   off an  old  tire so  it would   lap  around    the  flat tire  you  left on  the   rim  and make   a  hard   rubber   tire  you  could   ride  on.  He   almost broke  my   arm   when   we   Indian  wrestled.   While    we  were waiting   for the  snow   to melt  in  the mountain     passes,  my father  passed   the time   in the  station  lobby   talking  about his railroad   experience    with   the  agent.  When    the  snow began   to melt  Don   just  rode  along  with   us, since  we  had the room.\n\n  In  Arizona    we  heard   of a  hole  in the  earth,  wide  and deep   as  a canyon,    made    by  a  falling   meteor,   but  we couldn't   see  it from   the  road.   It snowed,   in  Flagstaff, where   Don   left us,  and  we  spent   the  night  in the  warm station  lobby.  Near   Siberia,  California,   or  where    ithad once  been,   I didn't  see  the  turn   in the  road   and  drove about   fifty yards   or  more    into  the  desert's   soft  sand.\nThat's  where   we  were,   wondering    what   to do  next, when\nDon   came   along  riding   a motorcycle    with  a  sidecar.  My father  sat in  the  sidecar,  and   I rode  on   the  rear  of the motorcycle,   holding  on  to  Don.  That's   why   we  arrived  in\nSan   Bernardino    with   my    eyes  so  windburned      I  could hardly  see  it.My    lips were   so chapped    it was  painful   to suck  on  oranges.   The   orange   trees  grew   right  along  the road,  rows   and  rows   of  them,   leading   back   toward   the mountains,    some   of the  oranges   so  close  we  could  reach out and   pick  them.   My   father  had  the  address   of a  man in Cucamonga,      but he  was   no  longer  living  at that  number, so we   went  on  ahead,  between    the  orange  groves,  the shimmering    sky  and   the snow-capped      mountains.    I don't remember    saying   much   until  Azusa,   where   we  ran  out  of gas.",

    "full_text": "In   Los   Angeles  we   found  a  room   off Seventh  Street,  in\n    the  home   of a widow    who   was  one  of  Aimee   Semple\nMcPherson's     angels.  When     she  was  not  in  the  temple, she was   at home   taking  long  hot baths.  I had  most   of the day  to walk   up   and  down    Main    Street, looking   at  the watches   in  the  pawnshop     windows.    On   the  cold  rainy days  I took in  the shows   at the  Hippodrome.     Sunny   days\n\nI sat in the  park  on  Olvera   Street,  where   Sunset   Boulevard ended   at Main   Street.  George   Young,   who   was  from\nCanada,    and  hardly   any   older  than   I was,   had  swum from  California   to  Catalina   Island  and   won   $25,000   of\nWilliam   Wrigley's   money.   I saw  him   swim   in a big  glass tank  of water   on  the  stage  of Grauman's     Chinese   Theatre. Back   in Chicago    there  was   snow   and  slush  in  the streets and  you   could  almost  freeze  waiting   for a  streeti car. Who    would   ever  believe  that  I  was  here   in California, the  sun  warm   on  my   face.\n  Twice    a day   I ate  the flapjacks   that  were   cooked   in a window    near  the  Hippodrome.      One   day  I saw   the Greek actor  with  the  one   leg at  a lunch   counter   in  the  Pacific\n\nElectric  Car  terminal   on  Seventh   Street,  but  he didn't  see me.  My    father  took  a  position   with   Western    Union    on the  strength   of  his  experience    with   the   Union    Pacific\nRailroad.   I could   see him,   in  the office  on  Main    Street, typing  out  telegrams    to be  sent  as night   letters, his shirt sleeves turned   back  to keep   his cuffs clean.  We   planned   to get a  car  and   drive  to Long    Beach,   where    some   people lived who   were  my   second   cousins  and   had  come   out here from   Ohio.   If it ever  stopped    raining   I  planned    to get down   to  the  ocean   and   take  the  glass-bottomed     boat  to\nCatalina.   Running     an  errand   for  the  widow,    who   paid me   for  it, I discovered    Echo    Park   on   West   Wilshire, where   there  were   swans   on  the  lake  and   rowboats    to be rented.  Even   my  father  didn't  believe  me  when    I told him\n\nI'd seen  real swans   on  a  lake  in February.\n   One   afternoon   in  Pershing   Square    I saw  my   father  in discussion   with  a  woman.    He   looked   good   when   he  was sitting and   talking,  with   one  leg  crossed,  his  arm   along the bench   back,  the fingers  of his  right hand   hooked   to his vest pocket.   I  didn't  have  to  hear   him   to know    he  was talking  about   raising  capital  for the  egg  business,   or this boy  he  had  who   needed   a  new   mother.   When    she  left he crossed  the street  to the  Biltmore,  as  ifhe  lived  there, and sat  in the   mezzanine     arcade   chewing    on  toothpicks.    It was  easy   to see  that  his  pants   no  longer  went   with   the coat. Although    I'd meant   to  spy on  where    he was   going,  I changed   my   mind.  California   wasn't   all he'd  expected   either, full of people   who   were  tight-fisted  with  their  money, or  women    who   were   suspicious   of anybody    not  from\nCedar   Rapids.   My   father  had  been  to Cedar   Rapids,   and ifthere  was  one  town   that made   Omaha     look  pretty  good, that was   it.\n  In  the streets  south  of Main   were   the used  car  lots,and\n\nI began   to read  the  messages   printed   on  the windshields.\nOne  that  caught   my   eye was   a dark   green  Marmon     with wire  wheels.   On  the  windshield    itread,  sweet    runner/\nMAKE   OFFER.\n  This   Marmon      had  a  Red   Seal  airplane   motor,   and  a hood  so long  and  high   the driver's  seat was  like  a cockpit.\nWhen    I scrunched    down   in the  seat the  radiator  cap  was on  my    eye  level,  like   a  gunsight.    There     were   two foldaway   seats  in the  rear,  with  room    to spare  for  some luggage.  The   salesman   said  he was   from  Des   Moines,   but he  had  been   to Omaha     with   the  American    Legion,   and seen  the  Ak-sar-ben    parade.   \"Tell   your   daddy   to make me  an  offer,\"  he  said.  \"She's  a  real  sweet  runner,   with good  rubber.\"\n  The   good  rubber   was  hard   to see on  such  small  wheels.\n\nI got the  idea  that  maybe   ninety   dollars  would   buy   it,if we  didn't  rile up  the  salesman.   I  took  my  father  around for a  look   at it, and   sat  behind   the  wheel    while   they talked  about  it. My   father  couldn't  even   crank  a car,  but you  couldn't  tell him  anything    about  them.   \"That   car's a gas eater,\"  he  said,  which   was  something    he'd  picked   up somewhere.    It was   painful  just to  hear  him  talk  about  it, since I wanted    itso  bad  itmade    me  ache  to look  at it.\n\n  \"Kid,\"    my   father  said,  \"when    he  really  wants   to sell that car  we'll be  back.\"\n  Wonderful     as  it was   in  Los   Angeles,   compared     with what  it was   like in  Chicago,   there  was   no lack  of  people who   had  found    that  California   hadn't   lived  up  to  their expectations.   They   didn't  like the  natives,  most   of whom were  from   somewhere     else.  Others   were   not  so  keen  on the climate.   They   missed    the snow    in the  winter.   They missed   the  coming    of spring.   We   could   have   filled two cars with   the  people  who    wanted   to  leave, but  not  all of them   could  put   up  the  money    on  short  notice.  We   narrowed   itdown    to seven,  not  counting   the  fox  terrier  that would   ride  with   me   in  the  front  seat.  A   sailor  named\nRed,  going   home   to  Pittsburgh,   sat on  one   of the  spares with  my   father. Mr.   Olsen,   about  the  size of  two  people, was  only   going  as  far  as  El  Paso,  where    we   would   all have  room   to spare  when    he left. A  ten-year-old   boy  who had  an  uncle  in Phoenix,    and  was  living  with  his  aunt  in\nAlameda    at the  moment,    wanted    to ride along   with  us  as far as  Phoenix,   but  experience    had  made   my   father  cautious. Places   on  the  map   always   looked   closer  than  they proved  to  be.\n   No   one  could   have   asked   for  a  sweeter-running      car than  that  Marmon      was,  as  far as  Redlands.    The   sailor,\nRed,  who   was   sitting on  a spare,  was   the first to say  that it sounded    like valves.  The   hiss  it made    was  more   of  a valve  sound   than   bad  plugs.  Up   till that  moment     I was inexperienced    with  valves,  which   were   something    an  airplane  motor   had  a  lot of. When    they  began   to seal up,  as we  got  close  to Redlands,    you  got  a  hissing  effect  like a calliope. We   got  there  in  time  to find  a  garage   before  it was  dark.  The   two  days  we  were   there  I got  to know   the mechanic   about   as  well  as I did  the  big  Red  Seal  motor.\nHis  name   was  Zeke.   He  wore   a hat  he made    by folding  a newspaper    to keep   the grease  out  of his  hair.\n  To   make   up   for the  time  we  had   lost in  Redlands   we drove  all night   through   the  Imperial   Valley   but  I  could see better  on the  map   how   itlooked.   In the  moonlight   the\nSalton  Sea  looked   black.  Near  Yuma    the  old  road  lay out on  the sand   dunes   like a  picket  fence  blown    over  on  its side. Just  out  of  Yuma    we   blew  a  tire and   it took  Mr.\nOlsen   to pry  it off  the rim.   Floods   had  washed    out  the bridge  on  the  Gila   River,  so  we   had  to  make    a detour through   Indian   country.  It was   more   of a pack   trail than a road,  with  gullies in  itso deep   there  was  a gap  between the front  and  rear  wheels.   In  less than  half  a day's  driving all the  tires were   flat.What    we  did  was  cut  the bead off the spares  and  just  let them   wrap   around   the rim,  the way  Don   had  showed    me,  or we'd   stillbe out  there  somewhere.  I learned   later in  Tucson   that  the  Indians  we   saw were  Papagos.\n\nAbout  a  mile  above  the  town  we   straddled  the  trail.Parts of it had   once  been   a road   and   there  was   wagon    room between   the boulders,   but now   scrubs  were  growing    at the edge  and  the  center  was   bare.  The  foot path   was  smooth and   dusty   with   donkey    manure.     When    we   knew    we should  have  turned   back  there  was  no place   to turn. It got dark  while   we  sat and   argued   what   we  should   do. Some\nIndians   stood  off a ways   and   looked  at  us.  When    I said\n\"Tucson?\"    one  of them  pointed   up  the trail and  we  allfelt better and   started  up  again.   It was  soon  so  steep  I had  to shift to low.  At  that  speed  our   lights were   dim   and  flickered  like afan   was  turning   in front. I had   to stop and   race the motor   to see  ahead.   Coyotes   were   thick as  cats  behind a store.  Their  eyes  blinked   at the  lights  and  when    we  got by they  sat  and  howled,   the  echoes  nice  but  the  real thing too near.   There   were  gullies   that almost   stood  us  on  end and  bent   the  bumper    back   on  the fenders,   and   bumps    I had  to squeeze   around    or drag   the  rear  end.  .. .The   battery was   running   down    with  the  lights on  and   I kept  racing  the  engine    like  hell all  the  time.   But   she  had   the power   to  burn,  even   when    the  hood  rose  up   like a  wall.\nAfter  a  while   I kind   of  liked  it, kind  of  wanted    bigger gullies,  liked  to give  her   the  soup  and   watch    her  climb right  out.  She  had   enough    stuff  in  low  to  climb   a tree.\nWhen    it got  really  bad   Red   walked    up  front,  his  white cap  pinned    to his behind   . .. when   the  road   eased  off we rolled along   in second   and   itfelt like  high,  which   showed how   itwas   back  where    we'd  just come   from*\n\n  After   we   left the  Papagos     trading   post  there   was   no road  at all, just  the  downgrade     slope   covered   with  scrub and  cactus,  a  smudge    of  smoke    way   off to  the  southeast that might   be  Tucson.    Except   for me   at the  wheel,  everybody   walked.   Now     and  then   I  could  see  the  mirrorlike flash of sunlight   on  a car  windshield.    We  came   out  on  the level beside  an   irrigation  canal,  with   the  road  to  Tucson on  the far  side of  it.Everybody     took  a  rest, soaking   their feet in the  water,   then  we  had   to go  another   ten  miles  to\n\n  *My  Uncle Dudley, 1942.\n reach  a  crossing.  I didn't  mind    it so much    as the  others, because,  as  my  father   said, I didn't  know   any   better. And for  another   thing   I  was   driving.   Tucson    wasn't   at  all what   I thought   itwould    be, but  we  were   able to  buy  good secondhand    tires  from  a  man   with   a machine    for  putting them   on the  rims.  He   didn't  seem  surprised    to see us  and wasn't  at  all talkative  while  he  worked.\n   Clear  over  near   Deming,    in  New    Mexico,    the threads stripped   on  the right  front  wheel;   when    it dropped    off I could  see it for a  moment    at the  rim  of the  lights. We   had to wait   tilldaylight   to  find  it in  the  desert,  then  spend half the  morning    jacking  up   the front  end.  Crossing   Texas-there  were   days  we  made   as  much   as  150  miles.  It was cold driving   at night,  but  warmed    up   fine during   the day.\nWindburn     alone   gave  me  a good   tan,  and  I often  had   the sun  on   my   face  in  the  morning.     I especially   liked  the country   around   Shreveport,    Louisiana,    where    the  shacks back  in  the  woods    were   like  cans  of  Log   Cabin    syrup.\nThe   colored  people   hadn't   seen  many    cars like  ours,  and most  of them   waved.\n  Just   before  noon   we   rolled  into  Lake   Village,  Arkansas. There   was   a lake  with  a pier  at the  foot of the  street, but it was  no  resort.  The   road just  ended   there,  facing  the water,  so  I had  to turn   around   and  go  back   to the tracks.\nCrossing    the  tracks,  which    I  did  real  easy,   I felt  this thump   like  the wheels   had   dropped   off in  the rear.  When\nRed  got  out  to check  the  wheels   they  were   stillthere,  but the  rear-end    transmission      had   dropped     right   on  the tracks.  I could   tell that  the  two  or  three   colored  people who   came   closer   to look   at  us  thought   we   were   crazy.\nWe'd   been   driving   all night,   and  with   Mr.   Olsen    gone there was   room   enough   to sleep  in the  back  seat.  It was  so warm   flies buzzed    around   us,  but  nobody   moved.    My   father sat on  one  of  the spares,  his  head  resting  on  the  back of the  front  seat. Red   walked    around   to  the  back  side  of the car  and  peed  on  one  of the  wheels.   They   had  a  general store,  and   a  feed   store  with   this  hand-cranked      gas pump,   but  no  garage.  I was   so tired  I just sat there  at  the wheel   as if waiting    for a  train  to  hit us.  In  the  quiet  I could  hear  the  far-off  pealing  of  bells.\n  \"Maybe      they  just  heard   the  war's   ended,\"    said  Red, and  guffawed.\n  A   flat  wagon,    hitched    to  some   sleepy   mules,    came down    the  street  toward    us,  then  turned    at  the  corner.\nPacked   tight  on  the  tailboard,   their  legs  dangling,    were fiveor  six colored   boys, one  holding   a  puppy.   They   didn't holler or  wave,  they  just  sat there.  A  white   man,   wearing an  apron,  came    out  of the  general   store,  put  two  fingers in his  mouth,   shrilly  whistled.   All  my   life I had  tried  to do  that,  and  couldn't.   Both   Red   and   me   looked   at  him with  admiration.    Red   said to  him,  \"What    happened?\"\n   \"Levee   broke,\"   he replied,  and   went   back  inside.\n   Everything    he  owned   Red   left in  the duffel  bag   on  the running    board.   \"Let's   go,  kid,\"   he  said  to  me,   and   I climbed   over  the door,  forgetting   all sorts of  stuff I meant to remember      under   the  front   seat. We    were   both   good runners   and   caught   up  with   the wagon,    but  it was  moving  so slow   we  went   right  by  it. Up   ahead   of us,  where the road   forked,  we   could  see  people   strung  along   carrying sacks  and   parcels.  I could  see that  what   I'd needed   all these  weeks    was   a  good   long  run.   We   passed    a lot  of people,  all of them   friendly,  to  where   the  road  ended   at a pier. An   excursion   type  boat,  with   a canvas   awning,   was taking  on  people.   They   stillhad   room   when    we  took  off, but it seemed    so calm   and  peaceful   I didn't  worry.   There was  hardly   a  ripple  on  the  water   until  we  got  to  where we  could   see it moiling.   It  was  more    like a  lake  than   a river  but  we   could  see  by   the  shore  how    fast  we  were drifting.  I didn't  really  understand     what   a levee  was,  or what  it would   mean   to  have  a break   in it,until  we  got out of the  boat  near   Greenville   and   I saw   the  whole   city  in the hollow    below   us, the  river  maybe   thirty  feet  or more above  it. Except   for  the queasy   feeling  that  it gave  me,  it was  a nice  warm,    balmy   spring   day.\n  Once    we  got across  the  river I could  see  that Red   didn't want   me  tagging   along   behind   him.  Two    people   made   it harder   to  catch  a  ride.  He   said  I  should   look   him   up when   I got  to  Pittsburgh,   and   gave  me  his  home   address and  two  dollars.  I was   on my   own.\n\n   I spent  the  night   in the  Greenville    depot,  waiting    for the levee  to break   and  the  river  to wash   us  all away.  The station  was  crowded    with  people   looking   for their  friends and  relations.  I thought    I might   find  my   father, since  he felt more   at  home    in  a railroad   station   than  anywhere else. I didn't  see  him,   nor  did  I  see Mr.   Hansen,     a big\nSwede   I had   grown   to  like. The   fact was,  except   for Red and  my   father, I wasn't   sure  how   many    of us had   arrived at the  river.  We   had  been   so  long  crossing   Texas   I  had lost track  of both  time  and   people.\n   In the  early  morning,   on  the  road  going  north,  a  traveling  salesman    in a  Maxwell    coupe   took   me  almost   as  far as Memphis.     If I hadn't   minded    making   all of  the stops  I could  have  ridden   with  him   farther.  He  called  the  colored people  in  the  cotton  fields on  both   sides  of the  road  a  lot of niggers.  He   didn't  mean   it bad.  He  liked  most   of them.\n\nIt was   very  exceptional,    he  told  me,  to  see  a white    boy like me  walking    along  the  road  in  Mississippi.   I said  that\n\nI was   headed   for  Chicago,    but  not  that  I'd  come   all the way   from   California.    If I'd  told  him    that  he  wouldn't have  believed   me.  For   all their  traveling,   the  salesmen    I met  hadn't   seen  as much    of the  world   as I had.\n   There   was   a  lot of flooding   around    Cairo,   but  it was easy  to hitch  a ride to  St. Louis.  Until  they  heard   me   talk, most  people   thought    I was   a victim   of the  flood,  looking for my    relations.  In  the  St.  Louis   bus   station,  where    I spent  the  night,  I  got to  talking   with  one   of the  drivers.\nHe   said  if I would    stand   on  the  corner   he   told  me,  he might   pick me   up,  then  again  he  might   not.  Itall depended. But   there  was   a chance   he  might.   I was   there  on  the spot  he told  me,  and   that's how    I got a  free ride  from   St.\nLouis   to the  Loop   in Chicago,    my   hometown.\n\n   It was   still only   April,   but  a  warm     drizzle  made    it seem   like  summer,     the   streets  slick  and    sticky.  I just walked    around   and   around    in the  Loop,    feeling  good   to be  back.  I had   a  piece  of pie  at  Pixley  &   Ehlers,   where you   can  see  people   making     them    through    the  window, then  I  took  a Clark    streetcar  to  Menominee.      It was   like they  all said,  there's  nothing   like spring   in Lincoln    Park.\nA  team   with  uniforms    was   holding   a baseball   practice  on one  of the  diamonds    that  was   not  too muddy,    and   I could see the  batter  hit  the ball  before  I heard   the  crack.\n   My    father  had   arrived   two  days   before   I did,  but  he was   stillin  bed  catching   up   on  his sleep.  While    he  fried some  eggs  he  told me   of his plans  to  get back  into  the egg business.  Until   he  raised  the  capital,  what   he  would    do would   be to work   nights  for  the railroad,  sorting  waybills.\nWould    I  like to  know    what    he  had   learned?   I  said  I would.   Kid, he  said, take  my   word,  the  grass  isn't greener on the  other  side  of the  road.\n   At the  Y  Mr.   Shults  was  glad  to see  me  and  offered  me the job   I had   had  in  the  lobby,  but  the  truth   was  I  no longer  felt  like working    with   kids.  I did  help  him   with the  Bible   Club   on   Sunday,   where    I  gave   them   a  talk about   my   trip  to California,    but  seeing   the  world   had given  me   ideas.  I forget  what   they   were,  but  almost   everywhere    I looked  the  grass  looked  as  green  as  Christmas jewelry.\n\n   I took  a job  as  office boy  in  the  insurance   department of the  Commonwealth       Edison   Company      in the Loop.   My job was   to air out  the office  in the morning,    adjust  all the blinds,  and  stamp   and   seal a  lot of letters.  I also carried checks  that  had  to be  signed  to Mr.   Samuel    Insull's  office on  the floor  above.  He  was   a small,  quiet  man   who   didn't say much,    and  looked  pretty  dried  up.  I'd seen  people  like him  in  California.   On  those  days  there  were   not  so many letters to stamp   I got  in a  lotof  drawing   practice.\n\n   If I  was   offered   something    big  with   Commonwealth\nEdison    I would    stay  with   them,    and   save  my   money, otherwise    I looked   forward   to  being   with  my   friends  at\nLakeview    High    School.  We   didn't  horse  around    so much as we   used  to, but  talked  a lot about   what   we  planned   to do.  Gene   Logsdon    was  dating   some   girl named    Florence, so  we  hardly   saw  him   on  weekends.     What    I planned   to do,  and   right  away,   was  build   myself   up.  I  had  grown two  inches   in  about   five  months,    but  I  was   stringy   as pulled  taffy. Traveling    around    with  grown    men,   I took  a lot of kidding    I wouldn't    have  taken   if I  had  had   more muscle.  In  the window     of a drugstore    on LaSalle    Street, I saw  a man    with  a  build  like Lionel   Strongfort   exercising with  a strip of  rubber.  He   could  make    every  muscle   in his chest ripple   with  it. I didn't  believe  everything   that  I saw or read,  but  itwas   less than  a dollar,  with  instructions,   so\n\nI bought   it.Just   before  I went   to bed  I exercised   for  half an  hour,  and   drank   a  pint  of milk   along  with   a  cake  of\nFleischmann's     yeast.  It took  some    doing  to  get  the yeast down,   but  chocolate  milk   helped.   I couldn't  believe  it myself when    I went   to the  Y  and   saw   how   I looked   in  the locker-room    mirror.   I'd gained   more   than  four  pounds    in about  three   weeks.  On   the  strength   of that  I exercised   in the morning     for at least  twenty   minutes    before  I went   to work,   and   I  used   a  spring-grip    exerciser   when    I  was walking   around    or riding  the  streetcars.  I drank   an  awful lot of milk.  Eddie    Kovack,   the  Y  phys   ed  instructor,  saw me   doing  exercises   on   the  parallel  bars.   I could   see  he couldn't  believe  it. \"What's    going  on  here?\"   he  said, feeling my   triceps.  It wasn't   hard  for  me  to keep   at anything that worked.    I got permission    to pull  the  weights   at the  Y on  Sundays,   after  I had  finished   with  the  Bible  Club.\n   My   boss  at work,   Charlie   Miller,  who   came   to work   in his slippers  because   he  had  foot  problems,   had   a talk with me   about  my   future.   He  had   hired   me  because   we   were both  farmboys,    and   he  felt I had   a future   in the  department.   But  I let my   mind   wander.    He  could   see that  from where   he  sat. It had   pleased   him   to take  me   into the  department,    and   he  had   no   serious  complaints     about   my work,  but  increasingly    he  felt that  I was   not really  there in the  office with   the  rest  of them.   Not   100   percent.  So where   was   I?  I liked  Charlie   Miller,   but  I  couldn't   tell him   that  what   I had   on  my   mind    was  grass   so green   I could  almost   eat it. I saw  it everywhere     I looked.  I  said I really didn't  know    where   I was,   because   I'd already   been to so  many   places,   like Omaha,     Kansas    City,  Albuquerque,  Yuma,   Los   Angeles,   El  Paso,  Shreveport,    Louisiana, and  Lake   Village,   Arkansas,    in the  flood,  but  I knew   all right.\n  One    day  in  May    Charlie    Miller   held  my   legs  at  the window    of his  office while   I emptied   all of  our  wastebaskets  on   Lindbergh,     the   Lone   Eagle,    below    on  Clark\n\nStreet.  If there  was   one  thing   Lindbergh     knew,   Charlie\nMiller   said,  it was   where    he  was.   And    where    he  was going.\n   My   father  agreed   to pay  me  ten  dollars  a week   over  the summer     if I would    help  him   sort  his  waybills   at  night.\nThat   way   we  would    both  have   most  of  the  daytime   free.\n\nI'd come   to  work   about   midnight,    when    the tower   room was  cooler,  and  usually   work   until  about  daylight.   I liked being  in  the  tower,   but  I hated   the  work.   Handling     the carbon   sheets   of  waybills   blackened     my   fingers,  and   I picked   up  splinters  from   the  edge   of the  sorting   table. I didn't  like the  way   my   father,  so  he  could   sort  the bills better, always   flicked  his dirty  thumb    on  his tongue,   leaving  a  raw-looking     pink    spot.  He   worked     in  his  shirt sleeves, the  cuffs  turned   back,   but  leaning   over  the  table frayed  the  material   at the  front  of his pants.   He  was   getting a  pot, like Mr.   Miller,  and   after working    for an  hour he  had  to  rest and   get off his  feet. From    the  tower  room we  could  see  the traffic flowing   over  the  drawbridge,    and watch   it go up   like a  wall  when    a boat  passed.   High   at the top  of the  span  the  lights blinked   like planets.  Behind it the lights  of  cars  glowed    like a  fire at  an  oven   door.\nTwo   or  three   times  an  hour   my   father   would   pause   to look at  the clock  on  the  Wrigley   Tower.\n   \"What    time  is it,kid?\"   he would    ask  me,  but  he never remembered      what   I told  him.   He   didn't   wear   his  own watch   because    it made    a  bulge   in his  pants   where    he leaned  on  the table.  Some   nights  we   were  stillthere  when the sky  lit up  in the  east.\n   When    my   father   took  the  job,  and   the  weather    was good,  he  liked  to walk   down    Chicago   Avenue    to the  waterworks,   then  along   Michigan     Boulevard    and   the  Gold\nCoast  to  Lincoln   Park.  But   that  summer    his  feet were   so tired after  standing   all night  he  would   take  a  streetcar  to\nClark   Street and   transfer.  The   cars ran  so  seldom   at that time  in the  morning    he  had  time  to get  his breakfast   at  a\nThompson's      restaurant    between    transfers.   I  might    see him  sitting  in the  Thompson's     when    I passed   by.  On  the hot  summer     nights   there  would    still be   people   on  the beach   at  Oak    Street   sleeping    on  the   sand.   Before    I reached   Lincoln   Park  there  might   be  lights on  in the windows   of  the  top-floor   apartments    and   rich  people    with their  horses  on   the  bridle  path.  On    a walk   that   long  I must   have  done  a  lot of thinking,   but  if I did  I've forgotten what   it was.\n\nIf the old man   who   sorted  waybills   in the freight  yards  felt himself  more   alive there  than  anywhere     else, it had  something  to do  with  the tower   room  where   he  worked.   On   one side  of the  room   was   a  large  bay  window     that  faced  the east. A   man   standing    at  this window\u2014like        the  man   on the canal   who   letthe  drawbridge     up  and  down\u2014felt     himself in charge   oftheflow    of traffic,of the  city itself All that he saw   seemed   to be  in his province,   under   his  control. He stood  above   the  sprawling    freight  yards,   the sluggish   canal,  the  three  or four   bridges   that  sometimes     crossed   it, and   he could   look  beyond    all of these  things,   beyond   the city itself,to  the lake.  He   couldn't  see  this lake,  of course, but  he  knew    it was   there.  And   when    the  window     stood open   he  could   detect  the  smell   of it .. .In  the   windows along   the  canal  the  blinds   were   usually   drawn,    and  behind  the  blinds,  when   the  lights came   on,  he  could  see the people   moving   around.    Nearly   all of them   ate  at the  back of the  house,   then  moved    to the  front.  There    they  would talk, or  sitand   play  cards,  or  wander    about  from   room   to room   until  it was   time,  as  the saying   goes,  to  go  to bed.\nThen   the front  lights  would   go  off,other  lights  come   on. A woman      would    stand   facing    the  mirror,    and    a  man, scratching   himself,   would    sit on  the  edge   of the  sagging bed, holding   one  shoe,  peering   into  itas  ifhisfoot  was   still there.  Or  letting  it fall so  that  it was  heard   in  the  room below   .. .In  all of this there  was   nothing   unusual\u2014every night  it happened     everywhere\u2014except        that  the  people   in these  rooms    were   not  alone.   The   old  man   in  the  tower room,   the waybills   in  his hand,   was   there  with   them.  He had  his  meals  with   them   in the  back,  then  wandered     with all of them   to the front,  listened   to the talk,  and  then  saw by  his watch   it was  time   to go  to bed. He   sat  there on  the edge,  looking   at his feet or  the hole  in  the  rug. *\n\n   *The  WorksofLove.\n\n   In the  fall I went   back   to school   and  did  the  cartoons for the  school  newspaper.     I saw  my   old school   friends  on weekends,    when   we   either  took  in a  movie   or listened   to the New    York  Philharmonic     on  Mrs.   Johnson's    new   console radio.  To  get  it into the  front  room   the  player  piano had  to be  moved    out. We   listened  to  Wayne    King,   at the\nAragon    Ballroom,    and   I  first heard    Johann     Sebastian\nBach's  Air  for the  G  String  on  it. I bought   a ukulele,  and worked   especially   hard  on  \"Little  White    Lies.\"\n  In  my   English   class I sat across  from   a girl who   wore   a\nRed  Cross   Life  Saving   pin  on  her  sweater.   I, too,  was  a\nRed  Cross   Life  Saver;  I wore   the  pin  on  the  lapel  of my blue  serge   suit.  In  Dorothy's     excitement    to  answer     a question,  her  arms   waving,    the bone   pins  often  fell from her  hair,  which   I  retrieved.  The   bone   hairpins   between her  teeth,  her   arms   raised   to  rearrange    her   hair,  the downward     gaze  of  her  eyes left me   free to be  ravished   by the beauty   of this gesture.  In  the  curve  of her  arms   a halo crowned    her   light  brown    hair.  Dry-mouthed,       I  put   a tongue   to my   chapped    lips. I did  not  lack images    for my condition,  but  an  occasion   for  adoration.   In  the  hallways and  on   the  stairs  I plotted   ways   to  approach    her.   She usually  hugged    four  or  five books   to  her  front, an  apple perched   on  the  top.  I would   appear    at her  side  and  say,\n\"Gee,   I wish   I was  one  of  those  books!\"   I planned    to do so many    things   I am   no  longer   sure  what   it was   I did.\nThe   startled  glance  of pleasure    she gave   me  I remember.\nStrands   of her  light brown   hair  framed   her  face.  Idid  not have  the  words,   but  I was   at ease  in  a landscape    appropriate  to my  emotions.    Sir Gawain    and   the Green    Knight were   my  close  companions.     I approached     the  dark  tower several  times   daily.  Soon   I was   carrying    her  books   the eight  or ten  blocks  to  the  elevated  stop  where    we  parted.\nIn a swoon    of emotion   I returned   to  the Y  where   the  facts of life were  my   supporting    fiction. I shouted   in the  lobby, prayed   better  than   ever,  divvied   up   the  loot of  the  slot machine    raids, and   exercised   for at  least half  an  hour  on the parallel   bars  after the  lobby  closed.  Back   in  the room on  Menominee      Street   I gulped   down    a  cake  of  Fleischmann's   yeast,  and   washed    fig newtons    down   with   chocolate milk,  to increase   my  weight.   In  the early  morning,    as the school   doors  opened,   I  was  there  in  the  hall with   the pounding    radiators,   my   homework      assignments,    and   the plaster  statue   of Joan    of Arc   with   the  hole  in  her   ear where   marbles   were   inserted.\n\n   I might   see my   girl, a  wild  exchange    of glances,   when she made    a  brief stop  at  her  locker  to pick  up   a book   or fuss with   her  hair.  Under    pressure   my   father  went   with me  into  the  Loop,   where    I could   try on  hats  in  a  men's hat store.  I saw  my   small  pale  face  in the  large  three-way mirrors.  I compensated     by  choosing   a large  man-size    Stetson with   a rolled  brim,   like my   father's.\n   \"Better  it's a little big,\"  said the  clerk.  \"Give   him  time to grow   into it.\"\n   Had   he   noted   that  I  was   growing     in  other  departments?   My    father's   coats  fit me   in  the  chest  but   were long  in the  sleeves.  To   show   off my   new   muscles    I took my   girl  to the  beach    where    she  disliked   the  sand   and feared  the  water.   A  towel  tucked   about   her  plump    knees and  wide  bottom,   she  wore   a straw  hat  to keep   the sun  off her  face. She  did  not  swim   a  stroke.  The   Red   Cross  Life\nSaving   pin  she  had   acquired,   in  a swap    of pins,  from   a friend  who    didn't  swim    a  stroke  either.  Nevertheless,    I was  the  first person   to  slip my   hands   inside  of  her  raincoat, and  she  was   the  firstto  kiss, and  put  cold  cream   on, my   chapped    lips. She   was   far  and  away    the  best  friend this boy  had   ever had.\n  On   Sundays    I rode  the  streetcar  for two   hours  to  where she lived,  then  we  rode  for  another   two  hours   to the  movie. Back   at  her   place  we   sat  in  the  dark   of  the  stairs where   I developed   a  line of talk  that  was  more   than   prayer. Her    father   played   the  organ    in  a  movie   on   Clark\n\nStreet, where   he  led  the singing   during   the intermission.    I saw  him   only   in  the  dark.  He    pretended    not  to  see  us, rattling  his keys.   With   the  taste  of her  face  powder     still on  my  lips  I would   run   the  four  blocks  to  the  end  of the car line, where    the  conductor   might   be  changing    the  trolley, or walking    through   the  car  to switch   the seats  to face the other   direction.  I  often  had  the  long   rocking,  clattering ride  all to myself.\n\n   I had   proved   my   talents   for  prayer   at  the  Y.  Now    I learned   the  art  of  fiction  and  self-promotion.     Tirelessly and  silently  she   listened  to  my   weekly    adventure    serial.\nWhat    did  I say?  I remember      nothing.   My   life and   great times  had  filled me   with  impressions,    and   I planned   to be a  political  cartoonist,   like  John   T.  McCutcheon        of the\nChicago    Tribune.   The   one   of his  I liked  the best  showed a boy   daydreaming      in the  twilight   of an  Indian    summer day,  where    he  thought    he  saw    Indian   wigwams      where there  were   only  shocks  of  corn.  I,too,  was  given   to seeing things  where    there  was   littleto  see, or  to seeing   them   as other  than   what   they   were.  Seeing   a  picture   of my   girl, her  blue  eyes  tinted,  a wash   of color  over  a  blur  of freckles, my   father   turned   back   to  brushing    his  hair   in  the mirror.  \"You   can't  go wrong    with  her,  kid,\" he  said, as  if ithad   ever  crossed   my   mind.   I  resented   the  suggestion, but occasionally    wondered    what   it might   be like.\n  She   loved  music,   and  was   a voice  in  the  throng  in  the school  production    of Schubert's    Rosamunde.      Her   love of music  had   come   from  her  father.  At  one  time  he  had  had his own    orchestra   and   played   the  solo  violin  under   the spotlight.  But  with  the  new  sound   movies,   all the theaters needed   was  the  organ  playing   when   the  movie   was  over.  I don't think   he liked  me,  but  the  only  time  he  saw  me  was in the  dark.\n  On    the  streetcar   one   Sunday    night,   Dorothy     and   I heard  this  loud  guffawing    right  behind   us. It was   my  father, with   one  of  his  men   friends  from   the  office. They were  laughing    at  us. My    father  was   stilla  pretty  goodlooking   man    when    you   saw   him   dressed   up.   He   was wearing   a hat  so much    like mine   we  probably    looked  like a vaudeville   act or  something.    I didn't  let on  that I  knew him  from   Adam,   or  the hick  with   him,  who   had  a  boil on his neck  that  was   healing,  but  I  knew   that  my  ears  were burning.   It ruined  the  evening   for me,  for  both  of us, and when    I couldn't   explain   what    was  wrong    with   me   she said I  didn't  like her  as much    as  I used  to. The   moment she  said  it  I knew    that  I  didn't,  and   it  increased   my shame.   I lied and   said  that  I really  liked  her  better than ever, which    had  the  effect of  making    me   moody.   On   the long  ride  home    I saw   my   reflection  in  the  window,    the big hat  tilted on  my   head,  and  that  I looked   like a fool.  I took  the hat  off, put  in  on  the  seat beside  me,   and  left it there  when   I  got off. It was   like new,   that  hat, the  band stamped    with   my   initials, but  I  could  no   more   wear   it after what   had   happened    than   I could   a dunce   cap,  or  a nightpot.  I  was  so  full of pity  for myself,   my   throat  aching, I rode  past  Menominee      clear  to Division   Street, from where,   since  there  were   no  more   cars  running,    I had   to walk  back.\n  One   thing  that  I stuck  with,  because   it worked,   was   my exercise  program.     After  the   Y  lobby   had   closed   in the evening  I  would   get in  a workout    on  the parallel   bars.  In my   zeal  to be   Lionel   Strongfort   I  would   come    over  on\nSunday   for  an  extra  session.  Yeast,  milk   and  fig newtons were   transformed     into  muscles    overnight.    Beneath    the calluses  on  the  palm   of my   right  hand   I noticed,  and   ignored,  a  point  of soreness.   It did  not  go away.   And   I did not stop  my   workouts.    Soon   I was  hardly   able  to  make   a fist,and  the  skin  on  the back   of my   hand   was  puffy.  One\nSaturday   morning    I  spoke  to my   father,  showing    him   my hand.   He   thought   it was   just  a bruise   that  would    heal, but  we   went   together   into  the  Loop   to  see  the  railroad doctor  in  the station.  A  big  gruff  man   with   a lame   walk, he asked   me  what   I had   been  doing   to get such   calluses. I told him.  I think   we  better take  a  look inside,  he  said, and led me   to the  sink.  He  asked   my   father  to  grip  my  wrist while   he  turned   the palm    up, just  to  look  at it. Tell  me where    it feels a  little sore,  he  said,  touching    it with   a knife  blade,  as if all he  meant   to do  was   prick  it.He   was quick.  I watched    the  ribbon   of black  blood   ooze  from   the cut, thickened    with  the  creamy    cloud  of pus.  Just  what   I thought,   he  said, and  set me   on a  stool so I could   hold  my hand   in a bowl   of hot  water.  I had  to soak   itforever,  until it looked    parboiled,   then   he  wrapped     it  in  a  bandage saturated   with   a solution   that  would   shrink   the  flesh. In two  days  I would   come   back  and   see him.\n\n  I  spent  Sunday    with  Dorothy,    who   showed    great  concern, and   when    the doctor   saw   me  on  Monday     morning he said,  \"Well,  that  looks  a little better. I guess  we'll  just letyou  keep   it,not chop   itoff.\"  He  joshed  me,  but  I knew that he  meant    it.At  night,  the  hand   beside  me   on  a pillow,  I pondered    how   it must   feel to  have  one  missing.   I visualized  it with  other  missing   hands,   in a  bucket.  On   a visitto a class  at the Y  college  I had  caught   a glimpse   of a dismembered     cadaver.   I  lacked  the  nerve   to think   about such  matters,   and  accepted   them   as unthinkable     subjects.\nWhen    my  hand   was   removed    from  the  shrinking   solution it was  not   my  hand,   but   like that  of  a  mummy.     If  the fingers  touched   each  other  it was  like an  electric  shock.\n   During   this time   Dorothy   copied   out my   school  assignments,  and  held  my   hand  like  a bird  when   we  rode  on  the streetcar. It shamed    me  to  think  that my   love had   been  so weak,   and  I wondered     what   it would   be  like to  be  married. If  she  was  my   wife,   perhaps   my   love  would    grow strong  again.   But  Dorothy    planned    to  go to  Northwestern, where   she  would   study  music,   and  I was   working   for fifteen dollars  a  week   in the  cloakroom     at the  Y. The   Y itself had  changed,    with   open   houses   on  weekends,    and girls using  the  pool  and  the locker  rooms.   As  strange   as it seems,   the  water   in the  pool   had  a  different   smell  and taste after  the  girls had  used   it.Some   of  them   refused  to soap  when   they  used  the  showers.   They   had  dances   in the gym   on  Saturday    nights,  with  some   of  the girls  smoking in  the  lobby,  and   it was   no  surprise   to  me   when    Mr.\nShults  took  on  a  brand-new     Y  in Sheboygan,     Wisconsin.\nHe   said he  would    make   a place   for me   as soon  as  I had finished  school.  But  it was  Dorothy's    opinion,   and  I suppose  it was  mine,   that anyone    as smart   as  I was   owed   it to himself  to go  on to college.  But  the  only  college  open  to me,  besides  the  Y,  was   the  City  College   of  Chicago,   on the South   Side.  I had  never  even  heard   of it until she  told me  about  it. There   was   no tuition.  All  you  had  to do  was supply  your   own  books.   It wasn't  my   idea  of college, once\n\nI got a  look at  it,a  big barn   of a building,   like a  department  store,  with  a  basketball   team   nobody   ever  heard   of.\nOne  of  my  friends,  Bill  Miller,  planned    to be  a streetcar conductor,   his father   knowing    people   in the  department;\nOrville  Clark   was   going   to  Purdue    to become    an  engineer;  and   Maurie     Johnson    could   go   to work    the  day school  was   over  in  his father's  dairy.   Emmanuel      Guagliardo was   already  making    more   than  I was,  driving   a pie truck.  As  talented  as  I was,  I considered    myself   not  very talented.  What    I could   do was   apply   myself,   as I did  to drawing   and   exercising,  but  no  amount    of exercising   was going  to make   me   into Lionel   Strongfort.   I had  gone  with my   drawings     down     to  the  Daily    News     and   looked through   the  smoky    office  for  the  cartoonist,  who    didn't look at  all like an  artist when   somebody     pointed   him  out.\nHe  had   his sleeves rolled  and  his  shirttails were  out  of his pants.  When     my   father   looked   at the   want   ads  in  the\nTribune    some   of  them    always   seemed    to  have   him   in mind,   but  when   I looked   at the  ads  all they  ever  wanted was  boys.   I  was  no  longer   a  boy.  What    I was   was   not clear.\n   While   I  was  pondering    my   future   I received   a  parcel from   a man   in  Texas,   D.  V.  Osborn,   who   claimed    to be my   mother's   brother   and   my   uncle.  In  a  hand   like  my father's, the  point  of the pencil  put  to his lips to wet   it,he said  he  wanted   me   to  read  the  book   he  had   sent  me  to make   sure   I didn't  follow   a religious   calling,  like other members    of  the family.   The   book  he  sent  me  was   Elmer\nGantry,   by Sinclair   Lewis.  I had   never  read  anything   like it.D.  V.  Osborn   told  me  that  if I was   strong  and  willing to work,  he  would   offer  me  a job  running   a tractor  on  his ranch.  He   would   pay   me  thirty  dollars  a  month   and   my keep.  If at the  end  of  the  year  he  had  a  big crop,  which was  not  unlikely,   he  would    pay  me   another   20  percent, which   might   come   to  as  much   as  six  or seven   thousand dollars.  With   that  I could   do  pretty  much    as  I wanted.\nBut  I shouldn't   give  a thought   to any   of it ifI didn't  like to work.\n\n  I  knew   nothing   of  my   mother's   side  of the  family   but her  name,   Ethel   Grace   Osborn.    I had   the name    Wright\nMarion    from   my  grandfather,    but  I  knew   nothing   of  D.\n\nV. Osborn.   The   novel  he  sent  me  opened   my   eyes.  I liked it better  than   those   of  Alexander     Dumas     and   Walter\n\nScott. The   thought   of  riding  around   on  a  tractor  pleased me,  but  Ididn't  believe,  as I explained    itto Dorothy,    that\n\nI would   ever  get a  lotof  money   for  it.What    I would   get, if I  worked    hard    enough,    would    be   thirty  dollars   a month.    I wrote   my    uncle   to thank    him   for  the  book, which   I  liked, and   to assure   him   that  I  was  not  at  the moment    contemplating     a religious   calling.  What   puzzled me  was  why   he  should   think  I might   be.  He  didn't  know about  the  talent  I  had  for  prayer,  or  anything    like that.\nMr.   Shults   would   have   said, when    he  got  to  know   me, that I was   pretty much    open  to a  religious  calling, but  not in the  church.  Christian    service did  seem   to appeal   to me in those   areas   where    I was   good   at  it, counseling    the\nFriendly   Indians,   divvying   up  their  swag,   and  talking   to them   at camp   with   the  lights out.  I could   sure  use  seven thousand   dollars,  I wrote   him,   since I was   about   to enter college, but  I couldn't   afford  to gamble    on  it while  I was making   thirty  dollars  a  month.   If he  really was   my   uncle and  my   mother's   brother   I  thought   sure  he  would    make me  another   proposition\u2014but      he  didn't.  He   didn't answer my  letter, or  even  send  me  another   book.\n  Right   at the  last minute    Dorothy   decided   she  would   go to City   College   along  with   me.   She  said  she  didn't   feel that we   should   be parted,   but  what   she  really  wanted    to do was   keep  her  eye  on  me.  City  College   was  jam-packed with  girls  who   were    a lot  more   forward    than   those   at\nLakeview.    They   were  also  brighter.  That   was   also true  of the boys.   I had   never  had   to  compete   with   Jewish    boys before,  and   they   ran   circles  around    me.   Dorothy    had more  time   to study  than   I did,  and  filled me   in while   we were  riding  on  the  streetcars,  but  I was  getting  C's  in the history  of art, where    I was   smart.   I tried to  catch  up  on my  sleep  in  the study   periods.  In  late November,     flushed with  a  fever  and   the  need  to  write   a paper   on   Charles\nMartel,   I sat at a  table in  the library   where   college  pamphlets  were   available.  I  leafed  through    several,  then  began  to  read  about   Pomona     College,  in  California.   I  had almost  been   there. It had  been   along  the  route,  edging  the foothills, my   father  and  I had   passed  through    on  the motorcycle.  At   the   front  of  the  pamphlet      a  photograph showed    the  orange   groves   and   the  snow-capped      mountains. The    text  described   the  details  that  were   missing: groves  of oranges,   the scent  of blossoming     trees, shimmering  sunlight   on  snow-capped      mountains,    a  land  without winter   where    boys   and   girls  strolled  about    with   their books  in  an  eternal  summer,    tanned   by  the  sun.\n   On  my   fevered   imagination    this  had  the  effect of  a vision. After   all, I had   been   there.  I  was   a true  believer.\nThis  word   image   of  the cloudland    on  the  horizon   met  all the  requirements      of  my   extravagant     dreaming.     Did   I thieve  this pamphlet,    or  just the  picture?   Or  did  I  really have  need   of  either?   In  the   thralldom    of  this  vision  I made   my   way  home    to the  bed  just vacated   by  my   father.\nA  week   passed,  and   I was   stillin  it,one  of  the fortunate survivors   of that  winter's   flu  epidemic.    In  the  mailbox, where   my  father   seldom   troubled  to  look, I found   a letter, forwarded    from   Texas,   from  my   mother's    sister Winona, in Boise,  Idaho.   She  wanted    to tell me  that  they  all loved me,  that I was   one  of the family,   and  that  my  grandfather was  willing   to pay  my   expenses    if I would   attend   one  of the Seventh-Day      Adventist   colleges.  One   of these  colleges was  in the  mountains    north   of San  Francisco.   On   my   way to this college,  ifI decided   to attend  it, I would   stop  off in\nBoise,  Idaho,  and   visit with  my   mother's   people.\n   Was   not  this an  example    of divine  intervention?\n   My   father  thought    itmight    be, but  he  felt it was  long overdue.   He   recalled   that  my   grandfather,    before  I  was born,  had   lost a  fortune   in  land  in  the  Galveston    flood, and  later owned    property   in  Canada.    By  rights  I was  one of his  heirs.  Who    knew    what   he  owned    in  Idaho?   The thought   of  my   inheritance    spurred   my    father  to  take  a fresh  look  at the egg   business.\n\n   I hastened    to write   my   Aunt   Winona     that  I accepted my  grandfather's    offer,  but  I did not  think   itadvisable   to explain  that  I was  not  looking   forward   to a  religious  calling.  I had   never   heard   of  the  Seventh-Day      Adventists.\nWhat   appealed    to me,   and  seemed    divinely  inspired,  was that this college  was   in California.   In  one  way  or  another\n\nI had   to get  there.  I  would    appear   in  Boise,  Idaho,   as soon  as I received   the railroad   ticket.\n  With    sad  eyes  Dorothy    heard   this story  as  she studied my  reflection  in  the streetcar  window.     I was  wearing    one of my  father's  old topcoats.   I was  wan   and  pale-faced,   but buoyant    with  optimism.     She  saw   and   feared   the  worst.\nWhat   inspired   me  was   flight.\n  On    a  fiber  footlocker   on  loan   from   Orville   Clark,   I pasted  the  pennants    of the  Big  Ten   colleges  and  others.  I returned   to  City  College    to impress    my   history  teacher with  this turn  in my   fortunes.  She  had   not heard   of Pacific Union    College.   Had   I  finished  my   paper   on   Charles\nMartel?    I had  worked    very   hard  to  impress   this  woman whose   mocking    smile   both  challenged    and   disturbed   me.\nWhile   I stood  waiting   to be reassured    she turned   from   me to erase  the blackboard.    It did not  occur  to me   at the time, but  I think  she  resented   losing   a convert.  She   liked  boys who   were  both   anxious   and  hard   to please,  like me.\n   My   last  night  in  Chicago,   Dorothy    and   I went   to  see the  four   Marx    brothers    in  The   Cocoanuts.     Later   she cried, and   we  clung   together   in the  dark   stairwell  smelling  of wet   galoshes,   but  fifty years   would   pass  before   I could  measure    my   real loss against   my   imaginary    gain.",

    "full_text": "Two     of my   mother's   sisters, Winona     and  Violet,  with i^J   Violet's  husband,    met  me   at the  station  in Boise.  It was  so  dark  I saw   littleof  their faces.  We   drove  through the snow   to  a farm   in the  country   where   my   grandfather lived with   Violet   and  her   husband.    In  the  lamplight   at the supper    table  I first saw  their  smiling   ruddy   faces.  It was  explained   to the  old man   that  I was  the  son  of Grace.\nHe  looked   at me  with   wonder,   his  pale eyes  blinking.   He was   subject   to spells   of  absent-minded      confusion    and might   stay in the  barn  with   the cattle, or  attempt   to hitch himself  to a  plow  or  a wagon.   He   drew   me  to him  to  look at me  closely, his  hands  firmly   gripping   my  shoulders.   He remembered     my   mother    but  he  seemed   to  have  forgotten she  had  had   a son.  I could  see  in the  looks  they  gave  me that they  all doubted   my   existence   until they  saw  me,  and\n\nI saw  them.  The   sisters were   agreed   that I resembled    my mother.  That   I had  come   to them   in the Christmas    season was  a  gift  from   God   and   a  revelation.  Their   love  and interest in me   loosened   my  tongue.   I told  them  about   my travels and  adventures,    but  I did  not say  much    about  my father. Why    had   he  not kept   in touch   with  my   mother's people?  Seated   around   the  table  to which   four  leaves had been  added   were   the parts   of my   lifethat  had   proved  to be missing.   My   impression    of them   all\u2014the    old man    already   dozing,   the  sisters  with   their  open,   affectionate faces, the  warmth     I felt  to be  accepted   as  one   of their number\u2014restored       to my   mind   an  image   of  the  good  life that I had   once  glimpsed   and  put  behind   me.\n   Later  I shared   a large  bed  with  two  of the  men,   one of them  Marion's    husband,    and  in the  hushed   darkness,   the fire crackling,  he  explained   that  if I did  not find  the college what    I had   expected   I need   not  feel bound    to stay there. They   would    understand.    In their  interest in me,  in their  loving  remembrance,      after  all  these  years,   of my mother,   they   were   unlike   any   people   I  had   ever  met.\nMeeting    them    provided    me   with   an  image    of  human goodness   that  I  had   been  lacking,   and   I sensed   that  it need  not  be good   for me  to be  good  in  itself.\n   In the  morning,   from   Marion,    I learned   that my   Aunt\nWinona    had  once   had  a beau   and  planned    to marry,   but on the  ride to the  train her  husband    told me  that  although\nWinona     was  a  remarkable     woman,    no  man    would   take the place  of Jesus   in her  affections,  unless  itwas   me.  My mother   had   been  her  favorite  sister, and   she  had  waited all these  years  to  meet  me.   He   doubted   that  my   mother could  love  me  with  such  purity   of heart.\n\n  No   one   had  ever  spoken   to  me   in this  manner    of the purity  of love.  My   eyes  brimmed     with  tears,  knowing    in my  heart   how   unworthy     of  such  love  I  was.  I  saw  her briefly at the  station, her  hands   in a fur  muff,  snow   sparkling in  her hair  when    she leaned   forward   to kiss me,   my heart  almost    bursting   with   the  knowledge     of  my   own losses. My   own   mother    would   have  spoiled  me,  and   deep in my  soul  I longed   to be  spoiled.\n\n  On    the  station  platform    at St.  Helena,    California,   I met  Mr.   Kirby,   a  barber   from   Los  Angeles    and  a  dead ringer  for  Calvin   Coolidge.   A  recent   convert  to  the  Adventist  faith, he  was   on  his  way   to enter   the  college  at\nAngwin.    Kirby    was   short  and   slight,  deliberate   in  his manner,    dignified.  I marveled    that  a  grown    man   would be  entering   a  college.  We    were   taken   by  car   into  the mountains    where   the  wooden    buildings  of  the campus    sat under   towering   trees  on  the  rim  of  a meadow.     Since  we had  arrived  together,   and  had  no  objection,  we  shared   the same   room.   Steam   heat  crackled   in  the  radiator.  Several inches  of snow   bordered    the paths   between   the  buildings.\nThat   was  not  my  idea  of California   but  I was   told it was unusual.   The   winters   were   cool,  with  considerable    rain, but  itseldom   snowed.\n   Friendly   young   men   came   to  our  door  to greet  us  and explain  the  rules  of the dormitory.    There   was  a curfew   at nine-thirty,  when    the lights  were  put  out.  In the  morning at seven  we   came   together  for  prayers,  then   proceeded   to the  dining   hall between    the  men's   and   women's    dormitories. My    friend   Kirby   greatly   impressed    me  with   his gallant  behavior    with  the  ladies,  something    that  he  had learned   as a  barber.  He   assisted  with   their chairs   at the table. He   passed   them   food  before   serving  himself.   During this  first meal   I learned   that  those  of Adventist    faith did not  eat  meat.   A  meatlike   preparation,    made    of nuts, carrots  and   raisins,  remained     on   our  plates   at  dinner.\nKirby   assured   me  it would    take  a  bit of getting   used  to.\nIn Los  Angeles    he had   frequently   sampled    similar  food  in a health   cafeteria.  His   own   health   good,  he  had   not  required  it.\n   Kirby  was   a devoted   reader   of the  Bible, but  not  in the manner    that  I read  it.What    he  read  he  took  to be  a fact.\nThe   whole   bit about   the  Ark,  with   the  animals   in  pairs, and  Jonah   swallowed     by  the whale,   he  accepted   as  history. He  saw   Jesus  walking    on the  water.  I had   heard  there were   people   like  that  but  until  I  met   Kirby   I  had   not known    one.  In  the way   he  liked  girls he  was   pretty  normal.  Soon   enough    I found   out  that  all  of the  readers   in our  dormitory    were  like  Kirby.   It was  news   to  them   that there  were  also  readers  like  me.  At  the Y,  I had  become    a staunch   supporter    of  Jesus,  who    took  on,  and   defeated, the  forces  of evil, but  I  was  pretty   skimpy    in matters   of doctrine.  The    first book   I  bought    was   a  leather-bound\nBible  with  two   ribbon   markers    to keep  my   place.  On   the flyleaf I put   my  name,   my   high   school,  and  after  considerable   thought    I put   my   address    as  Chicago,    Illinois,\nU.S.A.\n   Every   night  of the  week,  once   the lights  were   out, boys gathered    in  our  room    for  a  discussion.    Some    of them brought    along   flashlights   they   beamed     on  the   ceiling.\nKirby   sat on   a chair,  being   the oldest,  but  the  rest of  us sat  around    on  the  floor.  I  just  naturally   assumed     that when   they   all knew   better  they  would   be  reading   the  Bible  my  way.   First  I explained    how   it took  more   than  six days  to create  the  world.  In  the  Field  Museum     in  Chicago I had  seen  fossils of creatures   so huge   they  had  become extinct,  thousands    of  years  ago.  And    that  was   nowhere near  the   beginning.    I had   also  heard   about    mastodons preserved   in  Siberian   ice. With   my   own   eyes  I had   seen petrified trees  that had   grown   where   there  was   now   nothing but  desert.  How    did  I know    that?  I had   read  it, and believed  what   I had   read. They    really  crowed   to hear  me talk like  that, and   then  assured   me  that  what   I had   read had  been  lies. The   word   of God   was   written  down    in the\nBible,  and  I could  read   itmyself.\n\n   I didn't   believe  that   for  a  moment,     but  night   after night,  as we  sat  and  talked,  and   as I began   to make    converts, it crossed  my   mind   that  I  didn't  know   much    more than  they   did.  We   believed   what   we   had  read,   and   we had  read  different  books.  In  the  Book  of  Genesis   were  the boasts  of  a braggart    to impress    his  listeners, not   unlike myself.  The    pleasure   it gave  me   to  hold  their  attention was  like that  of a  prophet   speaking   to his  disciples. I was no  prophet,   but  they  were   sure   good  listeners.  They    all carried  what   I  had  said  to their  classes,  and   I was   soon advised   by  the  Dean    in a  very  friendly   and   considerate manner    that  my    own   faith  was   my   own    business,   but while  I  was  a  student   at the  college   I should   not  try  to convert  others.   Kirby   agreed   with   that, since  he  felt his own   faith was   crumbling.    There   were   trees in  California which   were   older   than  the   Bible's  story  of  creation.   If\nGod   could  be wrong    about  details  like that, He   had  probably  slipped  on  some   others.\n   I gave  the  Dean   my   word   of  honor   there  would   be  no more  discussions   after  the  lights were   out. I couldn't   stop what   had   been   started,  however,    and   most   of  the  time\n\nKirby   and  me   sat alone   at our  table  in the  dining   room.\nOnly  agnostics   dared  to  sitwith   us. Kirby   turned  for  consolation  to the  older  girls who   liked  to  take  walks   in the woods   on  weekends,    and   walking   around    the  campus    by myself  was   how    I stumbled    on  the  gymnasium.      No   one had  mentioned    they  had   a basketball   court,  and  three  almost  new   balls. The   building  was   pretty  dark,  and  on  the cool  side,  but  with   a  floor  so  waxed    it looked   new.   I played   for  about   an   hour   by  myself,   running     up  and down,   shooting   baskets.   The    next  day   I brought    Kirby along   with  me,   but   he  was   not  the  athletic   type.  If  I flipped  the  ball to him   it might   hit him   in the  face,  as if he didn't  see it. He  liked  to watch   me,  and   chase  balls for me,  but  I soon  got tired  of that.  Here   we  had  a real  gym, with  balls  to  play  with,   and  nobody    playing.   I brought the matter   up  with  some   boys  in our  dorm   who   seemed    to know   what    a  basketball   was.   They   didn't   know   much, but they   liked to  play. One   of the  problems    was  they  had to play  in  their  socks  on  a  slippery   waxed    floor. It was comical   to see them   skidding    around,   but  they  scrambled for the ball  like crazy.  They   hollered   and  yelled  like girls.\nTo  make   it more   fun, and   introduce   a littleorder,  I organized  them   into two   teams  of  four  players  each.  I'd never seen  grown   kids  get so  excited.  They   didn't  know   how   to shoot  baskets    or  really  dribble,   so  that  a  high-scoring game   might   be  about   six  points.  But   since  they  had   no idea how   awful   they  were,  they  had   a lot of fun.\n  After   three   or  four  days   we   had   about   twenty   kids, which   was   enough    for four   teams,  with   five on   a team, but  not one  of  them   letout  a  peep  about   the  rule against games.   The   reason  the  gym   had   been  sitting there   empty was   that  any   sort  of  competition     was   forbidden.    You could  come   in and  bounce    the ball  around,   the way   I did, but you   couldn't  take  sides and   play  a game   to win.  They kept  that  secret  to  themselves    because   they  were   out  of their minds   to play.  Skidding   around    in their socks  on  the slippery  floor,  they  often  fell down   and   got a  lot of floor burns.  Little  they  cared.   As  the  competition    warmed     up we  began   to have   some   fights under   the  basket.  One    boy had  a finger  poked   into  his eye.  There   wasn't   a game   we didn't  have  several   nosebleeds.   The   scrapping    didn't  always   stop  in the  gym    but  began   in  earnest   back  in  the dorms.   One    night  we   had   a  row,  with   pillow   feathers strewn   up  and   down   the  halls.  One   of  the smaller   boys was  tied  up  like  a  bandit   and  locked   in  a closet.  I had nothing   to do with   any  of this, but  when   the  Dean   looked into it my   name    was   mentioned.    I  had  been   the  one  to organize   them   all into  teams.   All of  that  was  acceptable where   I had   come   from,  but  it was   not acceptable    at the college. The    Dean   was   grateful  for  what   had  happened, however,   since   it dramatized    the  evils  of  competition.    I could  see  that myself.   When    boys   got excited   and  played to win  they  were   soon  indifferent  to  the pain  they  gave  to others.  Others   got  pleasure   in striking   one  another.   The\nDean    was   fond  of  me,   and   I liked  him,   but   since  my arrival  I had  brought   nothing   but  disorder   and  confusion to the  students  in  the  dormitory.   For  the  sake  of  the college he  would   have  to ask  me   to leave. He   would   write  to my  people,   however,   that  this  was  in  no  way  a  reflection on  my   character,   but  stemmed    from   the  fact  that  I had lacked   an  Adventist     upbringing.     The   opinions     I had voiced  to him   and  others  were   surely  made    in good  faith, and  my  own,   but  they  were  contrary   to Adventist   doctrine and  created  an  intolerable   confusion.   He  found   it hard  to believe  that  I had  been   one  of  their  students  just  under four weeks.\n  When     I was  asked  to  leave the  school,  Ididn't  want   to.\nA  budding    evangelist  myself,   perhaps    I enjoyed   making converts.  Here    at the  college   my   audience   was   captive.\nTheir   ignorance,   on   the  average,   was   greater  than   my own.   I could   look  forward\u2014if      left to my   own    persuasions\u2014to   modifying    the nature   of Adventist   doctrine.  The doctrine  could  also  look  forward,   as I had   told the  Dean, to modifying    me.   There    was   something    to  be  said   for non-competition,    and   I might  be  the  one  to say it.\n  The   Dean    was  pleased   to hear  that,  and  his  mind  was not closed   to possible   changes   in  my  own    doctrines,  but for the  time  being   he felt sure   that I  would   make   faster progress  elsewhere.    From   my   Aunt   Winona     I had  a  loving  letter assuring   me   that  what   I had   done  was   God's decision,  and  their  love went   with   me  in my   intention   to go to work   for my   Uncle   Dwight    in Texas.   I had  learned from   Winona     that  Dwight    was   her   favorite  brother.   I also  wrote   to him    that  I was   on   my   way,   and   that  I looked  forward   to word   from   him,  and  a  month's   advance pay, care  of General    Delivery,   Los  Angeles.   I believe that my   friend  Kirby   would    have   left with   me,  but  he   had become   attached   to a plump   young   woman     from  Glendale who   waited   on  tables.  While   in  Los  Angeles    he  recommended    Ishould   visit his former   barber  shop,  mention    his name   and  get  a cut-rate  haircut.\n  After   paying   my  coach   fare  to Los   Angeles   I still had about  twenty   dollars  in  cash.  I felt so sure  I  would   soon hear  from   my   Uncle   Dwight    that  I  took  a  room   in the\nYMCA      on   Hope    Street.  From    the  fire  escape   on  the ninth  floor  I could  see  the  lights, sparkling   like  stars, to the black   rim  of  the  sea at  Long   Beach.    Nothing    I had previously   seen   so  far  exceeded    my   expectations.    Just three  years  before   I had   been   in  Los  Angeles    with   my father, and   Iknew    my  way   around,   as well  as most   of the movies   and  pawnshops     on   Main    Street. I  rode  the  double-decker   buses  out  to Echo   Lake   Park   and  watched    the people  feed  bread  to the  swans   and  the  goldfish.  On  those days  it  rained   I  went   to  a  movie.   I  ate  when    I  was hungry.   Every   day  I took  the  long  walk  to  the post  office near  Olvera    Street,  where   I  expected   a  letter  from   my uncle.  I  got  to  be  friendly   with   the  General    Delivery clerk, who    was   from  Akron,    Ohio,   and  new    to the  city like I was.   On   the weekend,    with   the  PO   closed,  I rode one  of the  Big  Red   cars  of  the  Pacific  Electric  Railroad out to  Claremont,    the home    of Pomona    College.   I walked around   on  the  campus    like I  was  a  student,  saying   hi to the suntanned    boys   and  girls. What    itall made    me  think of was  the  Garden    of  Eden   with  oranges   growing    on  the trees of  knowledge.    The    snow-capped     mountains     looked so near  I could   touch  them.   On   the football  field  I sat in the bleachers   watching    the  shadows    rise on  the  foothills.\nNothing   more   beautiful   could  be  imagined.   I was   dazzled with  anticipation.   It also seemed    implausible   to me   that  I should   be deprived    of something    I  craved  so  profoundly.\nOne   thing  I would    do would    be  to write  my   Aunt   Winona  that   I had   found   the  school   that  I wanted.    Surely they  would   make   it possible  for  me  to  attend  it.If it had been   a weekday,     and  the   college  offices  open,   I would have  introduced    myself  to  the Dean    as a  prospective   student  from  Chicago,    with  relations  who   lived  in Hereford,\nTexas,   and  Boise,  Idaho.\n\n   I spent   the  night  in  one  of  the  ivy-covered    buildings with  windows     that  framed    the  snow-capped      mountains.\nWith   dawn    I was   still buoyant,    mingling    with   the  students  in the  hallways,   and  I presented    myself   at the office of the  person   in charge   of admissions.    Perhaps    he  sensed it was   idle to  calm   me.   He   allowed    that  a  young   man from  Chicago    might    have  something     to contribute   to  the college. I had   read,  and  agreed   with,  sentiments    carved. in stone  on  the college  gates.  Still buoyant,    my  future   determined,   I took  the   Big  Red   car  back  to  the  city, where    I found    a  postcard    from   my    uncle   in  Texas.     He   was pleased  to  learn  that  I had  left a school   that  taught  nothing but  lies and   falsehoods,   but  he  was  not  accustomed     to paying   his hired   hands   in  advance.   If  I was   to work   for him,   he  urged    me   to arrive   as  soon   as  possible,   or  it would   be  too  late. The    spring   plowing    had  started.  His wife, Agnes,    was  now   taking   my   place  on  the tractor.\n\n   I found    I was   short   the  bus   fare  to  Texas   by   three dollars.  The   PO   clerk  loaned   me  a  dollar,  and  I  pawned the silver-plated   initial buckle   on  my  belt  that I had   given my   father  the  previous   Christmas     but  borrowed     to wear to California.   After  all, we  had  the  same   initial. When    he wore   it,it was  always   concealed    by  his vest.\n   At the  Y,  where   I owed   a week's   rent,  I leftan  IOU    on the dresser,  giving   my  address   as  Hereford,   Texas.    I then went   down   the  fire escape   to the  second   floor,  where   the last flight of  stairs was   suspended    above   the  dark  alley.  I did not  weigh   enough,   even   with  my   suitcase, to  lower  the stairs  to the  ground.    When     I lowered    and   dropped    my bag   I was   puzzled    by  the  silence   of its  fall. I then   let myself   hang,  my   legs dangling,    and  let go, falling  silently into  a mound    of  fresh  garbage.   It stuck  to  my  hands    and clothes  as  I groped   in  it for my   bag.  I could   smell  it, all right, but  I couldn't   see  it until I  got into  the  light at  the end   of  the  alley.   Smears    of   grease   and   gravy,    salad greens,   chunks    of Jell-O,    clung   to my    pants.   I took   a streetcar  to Echo   Lake   Park,   where   I sat on  the  boat  pier, my  feet  in the  water,  while   I cleaned   my  socks   and  shoes.\n  The    bus  to  Hereford,    Texas,   which   proved    to be  near\nAmarillo,   went   through    Phoenix    and   Globe,   in  Arizona, which   were   places  I had  missed   on  the  trip west.  The   bus went   through   without    stopping,   but  the  drivers   changed.\n\nI dozed   off during   the  day,  but  I was  usually   awake    most of the  night.  In  a country    with  so  much    to see,  ithelped to see just  a small   piece  of it under   streetlights.\n   Without    the high   false fronts  on  the  stores  in Hereford\n\nI might   have   gone   right  through    it and  not  seen   it.The sunset  burned    like  a fire  in the  second-floor    windows     of the  general   store.  All  around    it, in  every   direction,   the panhandle    was   as  boundless    and  bare   as the  sea.  Having seen  the  sea, I  could  say  that.  It even  had   the  sort of  dip and  swell  that  the  sea  has.  The   man   in  the  general   store knew   my   Uncle   Dwight,     but  there  was   no  way   to get  in touch   with  him.   His   farm   was   about   eight  miles   southeast, which    was   a long   way   to walk   carrying    a suitcase.\nBut  if I left the suitcase   with  him,   I could  walk   it.He   led me   into  the  street, which    was   almost   dark,   but  the   sky was  so  full of light  I blinked   to look  at it. He   pointed  out to me  the  trail I should   follow,  and  the  wire  poles  along   it looked   no  higher    than   fence  posts.  The    road   was   little more   than   smoothed-over      grass,  and   once   it got  dark   it would   be  hard   to  see it. What    I had   to  look  for, once   it got dark,   were  the  lights  of his  house   and  his  tractor.  He kept  it going   day   and   night.  If  I didn't   see  it,I  would\n\n        hear  the cough   of the  engine.  The   light  for me  to keep   my\n        eye  on,  of course,   was   the one   that  stayed  in  one  place.\n        That   was   the  house.   If I walked    at a  good   smart   clip I\n        could  do  it in about   two  hours.\n           After  two  days  and  two   nights  on  the bus  it felt good  to\n        walk.  At  one  point,  where   I was   on  a rise, I could  see the\n\n        lights of Amarillo,    like a  cluster of  stars. I could  hear  the\n\n        tractor  coughing    before   I  saw  it, and   it sounded    like  a\n        plug  was   missing.  Some    time  later, when    it made   a turn,\n        the  lights  came   toward    me   like  a  locomotive.    The   last\n        thing  I saw   was  the  feeble  lampglow     at a  window    of  the\n        house.  I had   never  asked   myself   what   he might   have   as a\n        farm.   A  farm    to  me   was   a  big  old  house,   with   some\n        barns,  and   perhaps   some   trees  along  one   side as  a windbreak.  What    I saw  slowly   emerging    in the milky   darkness\n        was  a building   no  larger  than   my  Uncle   Harry's   cobshed,\n\n        set up   on  concrete    blocks.  A   line of  wash,   like  ghosts,\n        hung   to one  side,  where   a machine    of  some   sort was  covered  with  a  tarpaulin.   Fifty  or sixty  yards  away   from   the\n        house   were   two   sheds,   and   still further   away    was   the\n        peaked   roof  of a  privy.  The   white  spots  in  the yard   were\n        Leghorn    chickens.   Way,   way   off  to the  south,  where    the\n        sky  was   darkest,   the  dim   lights  of the  tractor   flickered,\n        and  it made    me  so  mournful    and  lonely   I wanted    to cry.\n\n        If I  had  not  come   so  far  and   was  not  so  tired,  I would\n        have  turned   back.  An   eerie  mauve   and   crimson   afterglow\n\n        filled the  western    horizon,   like  the  earth   was   burning.\n        Until   I was   right  there   in the  yard,   beside  the  sagging\nI       line  of wash,   the  dog   under   the  house    neither  saw   nor\n        heard   me.   When    he  came   at  me   barking,   he  scared   me\n        out  of my   wits.  I probably    let out  a  yell. At  the  door  to\n\n                                                                     , the  house,   up  three   steps  from   the  yard,   a  woman     appeared   with  a  clothes  basket.  She   called  off the  dog, then said,  \"You're   Wright?\"     I said  that  I  was.  \"I'm   Agnes,\"\nshe  said. \"Dwight's     on  the tractor.\"\n   With   the  light behind   her  I could   not  see her  face.\n   \"Where's    your   bag?\"\n\n   I explained   that  I had  left it in Hereford,   since  I had  to walk.\n   \"Dwight's    not  going   to like  that,\"  she  said.  \"It means he's got  to  go fetch  it.\" When     I said  nothing,   she  added,\n\"I suppose    you're  hungry,\"    and   beckoned    me  to come   in.\n\n   In the  morning    I saw   nothing   but the food  on  my   plate the slit of light at  the window.     It was  on  the  horizon,   but it might   have  been   attached   to the  blind.  Dawn.     Sunrise would   not  come  for  another   hour.   The   wind   blowing   under  the  house   puffed   dust   between    the floorboards,    like smoke.   There   was   never   any  talk.  My    Uncle   would   slip off his coveralls,  like a flight  suit, and   eat in his  two  suits of underwear:     one  offine,  snug-fitting   wool,  flecked   with gray,  like a pigeon;   the  other  of heavy,  nubby    cotton flannel  with   the  elbows   patched    with   quilting,   the fly-seat yawning.    The  outer  suit  would   come   off in the spring,   but the  inner   suit  was  part   of my    Uncle.   I once   saw   him, plucked   like a  chicken,  standing    in a  small  wash   basin  of water   while   Agnes    wiped    him   off with   a  damp    towel.\nDust.  He   was  dusted   rather  than   washed*\n\n   Sometime     before  dawn,    the  wind   rising,  I  was   awakened  by  the  cough  of  the tractor  approaching     the house.   It\n\n   *Cause forWonder, 1963.\n went   on  coughing    while   I  pulled   on  the  clothes   Agnes brought   me\u2014itchy     underwear     and   socks,  two  heavy   flannel  shirts, coveralls   still stiff from   drying   on   the  wash line, cold as  ice.\n  Agnes    had   explained     to  me  the   night   before   that  I would   take  over  the tractor  when    Dwight    brought   it in in the morning,    the  engine   never  stopping   because   it was   so hard  to  start. While    I gulped   hot  biscuits  and  eggs   fried in pork   fat I could  hear   my  uncle   cursing.  What    was  the trouble?   It was  just  his way   of keeping    warm,    talking  to himself.   When    he   came   into  the   house   dust  caked    his face, like  the  men   I had   seen  in  grain  elevators.  He   did not  look  pleased  when    he  saw  me   sitting there  eating   his food.  He  wore   a  cap  with  ear  muffs,   coveralls  like  mine, the  legs  tucked   into   three-buckle     galoshes.   I  wouldn't know    until  Sunday    what   he  really   looked   like, when    I would   first see  him   without    his  cap  on\u2014not     because    it was  the  Lord's   day   of rest,  but  my   uncle's  day   off. His forehead,   ears  and   neck  were   white   as  flour,  the rest  of his face  was   dark  as  an  Indian's.  Where     had  I seen   him before?   He   could   have   been  the   brother   of  William    S.\nHart.  He   had  the  same   steely, watery-blue    eyes  and  thinlipped  mouth.    When    he  smiled   I could  see the  dirt  caked at the  roots of  his teeth.\n   He  didn't  say  who   he was,   or ask  who   I was,  but  came to the  table  and   opened    up  a  biscuit,  smeared    it in the pork  fat, then  put  itin  his mouth.   I understood    right  then that you  didn't  talk to him   while  he  was  trying  to  eat. My uncle  was  a  lean  wiry  man   who   just  naturally   stood  with his legs  flexed,  as  ifhe   meant   to hop.   When    he  burned himself  with   a swallow    of hot  coffee  he  made   a  face just like  I would,    with   his  eyes  creased,   then   he  let  out  a stream   of curses.   I followed   him   out  in  the  yard,  where the  crack  of dawn    was   right  there  on  the  horizon    like a knife  slit,then   we  carried   between    us  a milk   can  full of kerosene   to the  John   Deere    tractor.  It took  both  of  us to liftit as  high   as  the  fuel  tank,  and   pouring    it into  the funnel   I got my   gloves  and   hands   soaked.   He   shouted   at me,  above   the cough   of  the motor,   if I knew    how   to steer a tractor?   I nodded   that  I did.  He  rode   along  behind   me, seated  on  one  of the  gang   plows,   letting his  hand   trail in the loam   turned   up  by  the plow   blade.  His  section  of land was  about   1,800  acres,  and  I could  see  only  a portion   of it at one   time.  With    the  tractor  running    day   and  night   it would   take  a month   or  more   to get it plowed.   On   the west side, headed    south,   the  wind   in  my   face  was   so  cold  it made   my   eyes  blur.  Headed    north,  the  dust  raised  by  the plows   blew   over   my   head    like  a  cloud   of smoke.    But when   he  saw   I could  manage     the  tractor  on  the turns   he got off  the plows    and  walked    back  toward    the  house,  his arms   raised  from   his  sides  as if he  carried   two  pails.  In that  great  empty    expanse,   the  sun  just  rising,  he  looked like a bug   and  hardly   seemed    to move.   When    the  light in the house   turned   off I  missed   it.\n\n   I'd been  plowing    half the  morning    before  I noticed  how the big  jackrabbits   moved    just enough    to stay  clear  of the plows.   They   would    wait  until  the  last  second,   then  hop just enough    to be clear  of the blades.   The  whole   section  of land  I  was  on   had  never   before  been   turned   by  a  plow.\nOnly   cattle  had  grazed    it,most   of  them   the  white-faced\nHerefords    that  stood  along   the  fence  to watch   me   pass.  I didn't  know    at that  point  that  I was   turning   topsoil  that had  been   centuries  in  the making.    My   uncle   knew   it,and it was  why    he  had  gambled     on  planting   grain   where   it seldom    rained.   If  it would    grow    grass,  he  argued,    it would    also  grow   wheat.   Just   five  years  before   he   had leased  1,200  acres,  and  he  and  Agnes,   working    alone,  had harvested    a  crop  worth    more    than   $30,000.    It hadn't rained  a  winter  since  then,  but  he was   sure  that it would.\n   In  the  sky   around    me,  maybe    twenty    miles   away,   I could  see  cloud  masses   forming   and   drifting.  I could  even see mauve    sheets  of rain  falling somewhere.     A  few  days  of steady  rain  was   all that  was   needed,   then  months    of hot sun.  I thought   I would   die  of hunger   before   I saw  Agnes, followed   by  the  dog,   between    the  plowed    land   and  the house.  She   brought   me   my   lunch  in  a syrup   pail, with   a jar of black   coffee. I'd  never  cared  much    for coffee,  but  I got to  like it fine. The   dog  would   stay  with  me,  watching me   eat, then  he  would    trail in  the  fresh  furrows   left by the  plows.   When    a  rabbit  moved,   he  tried  to head   it off and   keep  it running    in  the  plowed   section.  He   ran   like the  wind,   so  low   to  the  ground    that  a  plowed    furrow would   send   him   tumbling.    It was  hard   to  see the  grasscolored   rabbits  when   he  chased   them,   just  the crazy   zigzagging   patterns    made   by  the  dog,   like he   was  chasing flies. He  was   a sort  of spitz,  mixed   with   collie, his fur  a mat  of  burrs  picked   up  from  the  grass.  His  big  stunt  was to run  straight  at the  Herefords    ifhe  found   them   alllined up  like  a wall   at the  fence.  He   would   go  right  for them like a  streak, and  at  the last split second   they  would   break and   panic,  going   off with   their  tails  up,  bellowing.   We both  loved  it. I would   stop  the  tractor  and  give  him   some attention.   He  was   Agnes'   dog.  For  one  reason   or another he  didn't   like  Dwight.    I  think  it  was   because   Dwight would   often  shoot   toward   him   when   the  two  of  them   did a littlehunting.   It was   Dwight    who   gave  him  the  name   of\nJesus,  because    of  the  way   a  dead-looking    rabbit   would spring  to life when    he saw   him.\n\nTwo    hours   before  dawn    we   had   left the  dark   house   to shoot  at  what   I thought    might   be  cattle rustlers.  In  the windless   pause   before  my  Uncle   ran  forward    hooting   like an Indian,   I prepared    myself  to shoot  it out with   Billy the\nKid.  When    Dwight     ran forward,    hooting,   I shot  into the air over  his  head.  I heard   a great  flapping    of wings,   but very  littlehonking.   I  think  I managed     tofire  two  or three times.  Stilldark,   we  came   back  to the  house   where   Agnes had  coffee  perking    and  a  fire going.   When    the  sky   was light we   went  out  to see  ifwe   had  bagged   any   birds. Just shooting   blind  into  the  rising flock   we  had   bagged   nine.\nSo  we  had  fresh  gamy    meat  for  two   weeks   and  lead  shot on  my   plate  in  the  evening,   some    of which    I kept  and used  over  in a  bee-bee  gun*\n\n   The   John   Deere   tractor,  until I got  used  to it, sounded like a plug   was  missing   and  it was   about  to stop  running.\n\nIt ran  on  the  cheapest   fuel, however,    and  once   you  got  it started  itwas   hard  to  stop. To  start  itup,  you  had   to give the  flywheel   a spin,  which    scared  the  hell  out  of me   because  of the  way   itbackfired.   The   first time  itdied  on  me\n\nI couldn't  get  itrestarted,   and  Dwight    knew   it right  away when   the  coughing    stopped.   He   could   hear  that  the  way he  could  hear  a rise or  fall in the wind.   He   had  got out  of bed  at  about   seven  in  the  morning    and   walked    the  half mile  or  so to where   I was   stalled. That   gave  me   plenty  of time  to  watch   him   coming,   his  arms   high   from  his  sides\n\n   *Causefor Wonder.\n like a winded    chicken.  He   was  so mad   he  hardly   troubled to curse  me,   and  grabbed    the  flywheel   like  he  meant   to tear itoff. He   didn't catch  it just right, and   the loud  backfire lifted him   off his feet. That    made   him   even  madder, and  less smart  about   it,and  when    he grabbed    the wheel   it spun  him   like a top  and  thumped    him   hard  against  one  of the  wheels.    That    hurt   him    so  bad,   and   he   was   so ashamed,    tears came   to his  eyes. If he  had  had   a club  big enough,   or  an  axe,   I think   he  would   have   chopped    the\nJohn   Deere   to pieces.  The   reason  he  hated   his father  the way  he  did,  as  Winona    had   said,  was  that  they  were   so much   alike. They    were  both   hard-driving,   ambitious    men who   were  accustomed     to putting   the harness   on  others  as well  as themselves.    It almost  killed  him   to have  the  tractor, right  before  my   eyes,  make    a fool  of him.   It frightened  me  like  the devil just  to watch   him,  but  when    itwas over  Iliked  him   better, and  he  was  friendlier  with  me.  By the  time  we  got  it started  we  were   both   so worn    out we just got  on   it and  rode   it back   to the  house,   where    he went   back  to bed,  and   I sat  in the  sun  where    itwarmed the wall.  It made    a difference   between   us,  not such   a big one  that  my  job  got to  be  any  softer, but  I had   become   a hired  hand   and  he  didn't have  to  watch   me  to know   I was working.\n   As  a rule   I rode  the  tractor  all day,  and   he  rode  it at night.  He   slept  until  early  afternoon,   then   he  did  what needed   doing  around    the place.  Agnes    raised  chickens   for the  eggs  we  lived  on, and   the  one  she  stewed   or fried  on\nSunday.    By  afternoon   the  sun   would   heat  up   the  house, but  the   way   the  wind    blew   around    and  beneath    it, it would    soon   cool  off  in  the  evening.    After   supper    we would   sit around    the range   in the  kitchen,   with  the  oven door  open.    Agnes    always   had   her   mending     to  do,  or washing,   or the  baking   of bread  she  did  on  Mondays,    and she was   not a  person   who   liked to talk  while  she  worked.\nNor   had   I ever  before   lived  with  a  woman     who    didn't seem  to like  me.  Not  that  she disliked  me,  but  at most   she felt neutral.   In  the  house   she  liked   me  to  keep   in  my place.  The   year   he  made    a  lot  of money     Dwight    had bought   a big console   radio  in Kansas    City  that required   a lotof  batteries to  run  it.He   got tired of trying   to keep  the batteries  charged,   so all itdid  was   sitthere  with  her  sewing  on  it. In the  space   on  the  floor  beneath    there  were two  big  cartons  of  Haldemann-Julius        Little Blue   Books.\nThey   sold  for five  cents  each,  and  my   uncle   had  bought two  or  three  hundred     of them.   He   was   a  great  reader, over  the winter,   and  read   the books   that  he  liked  several times.  Most   of the  books  exposed    religious  hypocrisy   and fakery.  There    were   also  books   on   geology,   history  and travel, so I didn't  lack  for  something    to read.  I often  carried one  of  these  books   in my   pocket  and   read  it when    I stopped   for lunch.  What    surprised   me  was   how   much   my uncle  loved  to talk. On   the  day  I had  off  we  might   sit up tillalmost   midnight    doing   nothing   but   talking.  A  lot of what   I said  got him   to laughing    so hard   his  sides ached, and  he  could  hardly   stop. He   loved  to hear  me   talk about\n\nPacific Union    College,  and   the stuff  they  believed.  I liked the way   his  eyes  watered   when    he  laughed,   and  the  way they  twinkled   when    he  looked   at  me.  The   good   talk we often  had  was   no  reason,  however,    I shouldn't   be  on  the tractor  at dawn   the  next  morning.\n\nThat   morning   I heard   the dawn    crack  like a whip.  A  little later I  could  peer  out  and  see  the  wind   where   there  was neither   dust,  lines of  wash,   nor  even  grass   to blow.   The yard   was   like a  table,  with   a dull,  flat gloss   where   the shoes  buffed  it toward   the  privy.  Scoured   by  the  wind,  the cracks  had   been  picked   clean   by  the  chickens.   Out  there, as nowhere    else, I could  see  the  wind.  The  five  minutes   in the  morning    I lay in  a stupor   listening  to Agnes   build  the fire, I would   face  the  window,    the  dawn    like a slit at the base  of a door.  In  the  kitchen   Agnes   would   put  fresh  cobs on  the  banked   fire. Was   it the  sparks  in  the chimney,    the crackle  in  the stove?   The   cats would   hear   it,five or  six of them.   With   the first draw   of the fire they  would   start from the grain   sheds   toward   the  house,  a  distance  of about   one hundred    yards.  Was   that  sofar?   It can  be if you  crawl.  In the  dawn    light I  would   see  only  the  white   cats, or  those that  were  spotted,  moving    toward    the house   like primitive or  crippled   reptiles. How    explain   it? The   invisible  thrust of the  wind.    The  hard   peltless  yard   gave   them   no  hold.\nEven    the  chickens,   a  witless  bird,  had   learned   never   to leave  the  shelter  of the house   at the  risk  of blowing   away, like paper    bags.  A  strip  of chicken    wire,  like a  net,  had been   stretched  to the  windward     of the  yard  to catch   them.\nThey   would   stick  like rags, or  wads   of cotton, till my  Aunt would   go  out  and   pick  them   off. The   cats and   hens   were quick   to learn  that  the wind   would   prevail.   My   Aunt   Agnes  knew,    but  she  preferred   not  to  admit   it. The   last to learn  was   my   Uncle   Dwight.*\n\n   The   way   Agnes    looked   after my   Uncle   Dwight     helped me   to  see why    it was  she  seemed    so  neutral   toward    me.\n Dwight    was  hers.  She  liked  him   so much    she  didn't  want to  share    him   with   anybody.     The    way    he  could    talk\n\n   *Cause for Wonder.\n pleased   her,  but  the  pleasure   he  showed    when    I  talked made   her  frown   and  turn   to her  mending.    She  was   not a pretty  woman,     her   skin  darkened     by  the  weather,    her hands   like those  of a  man   and  chapped    at the  wrists,  but\n\nI knew   that  she  was  a  woman    my   uncle  could   take  pride in. He   had  found   her  in Kansas,   put   her in  a buggy   and driven  southwest    tillthey  came   to the Pecos   River  in New\nMexico.    There   he  homesteaded    a  claim  and  raised  sheep.\nWhy    didn't   they  have   children?    She  would    have   liked kids  of her  own   better  than  she  liked  me.  Dwight    was  so independent     in  all of  his  thinking,   he   might   not   have wanted    to share   Agnes   with  them.   He   talked   to her  the way   he did  to me,  but  he  considered    me  a better  listener.\n\nI would   come   back   at him.   And   he  liked that.  He   said a lot of things   just to  rile me.  I had   also  read  some   books that  he  hadn't,   and  that  both   pleased   and  shamed    him.\nSometimes     he  would   put   his hands    to his  face  and  just think  about   itfor  a moment,    in silence.\n   My   Uncle    Dwight     had   not  had,   as  he   said,  much schooling,   preferring   to educate    himself  by   reading,  but he talked  in  the assured   manner    of a man    who   could  give a sermon.    Words    came   to  him   easily,  and  quickly.   His accent  was  like  none  I had   heard,  as  ifhe  had   lived with strange  people.   I would   hear  nothing   like it until  I heard ballad  singers   on  records.   When    he  listened   to me,   his head  tilted as if for a  portrait,  I feltin  his gaze  his admiration  for his  own   kind.  Was   that  what   I was?   Were   we both  pieces  chipped    from  the  same   block?   It pleased   me to think  that  we  might   be, because   I  feltfor  him  a  secret admiration.    He  was   strong.   His  mind   was   sharp   as  the glint of  his  eye.  If the  great  men    I had   heard   of  were gathered   together   around   a  stalled  tractor  on  the  Texas panhandle,    my  uncle   would   prove   to be  the equal   or the superior   to most   of  them.   They   would    listen in  silence and  admiration    as he  cursed.\n  On   his  homestead     on  the  Pecos   River,  near   Roswell,\nDwight   had   found  small  six-sided   rocks, with   one or  both ends  sharpened    to a point,  like a  pencil, around   the  holes of small  rodents.   They   were   locally known    as  Pecos  diamonds.   He   kept  a  sampling    of them   in  a  Bull  Durham tobacco  sack,  and  brought   them   out to confound    city hicks like me.  What    in the world   had  led  God,   he asked   me,  to make   something    like that  in a  hole in  the ground?    Nothing  pleased  him   more   than   the  foolishness   of God   compared  to the  almighty   mysteries   of  nature.\n  The   greatest  marvel   of nature   on which   he  had  set eyes were   the  Carlsbad    Caverns    in  southern    New    Mexico.\nDwight    wanted   me   to see  them   the way   Winona     wanted me   to see  God.   We    stopped   plowing    for  three  days   to drive  there  in  his Willys   Knight    sedan,  the  car  he  kept under   the  tarpaulin    beside   the  house.   It  still had  the original  tires on  it,and  the  tools under   the seat  had  never been  used.  A   film of  dust  made   it all one   color, like  his face when    he came   in from   plowing.   It pleased   him  to sit in the  back   seat  with   Agnes    and  let  me   drive.  I knew about  Willys   Knights,   and  their  sleeve-valve  motors,   from the  one   my   father  had   had   in  Omaha     that  my   Uncle\nVerne   and  I would   take  on long  rides  into Iowa   and  Kansas. On    the  curves  I  could   look  back   and  see  the  blue exhaust.\n   Jules   Verne   could   have   used   the  Carlsbad     Caverns when    he  wrote   A  Journey    to  the  Center   of  the Earth.\n\n                                                                   I\n\nThat's  what    the caverns   were   like. We   went   down   there with  a  large  group   of people   who   had   come   from  places as far as  Minneapolis     and  Chicago.    We  all gathered    in a huge   cavernous    room,   near   a  large  rock,  and   sang   the hymn   \"Rock    of Ages.\"   When    our   names   were   called  out we  would    reply  where    we   had   come   from.   Learning    I was  from   Chicago,    a man    from   Milwaukee     came    to me and  threw   his arms   around   me.  He   had  lived  in Chicago, and  often  visited Lincoln   Park.\n\n   I found   the  caverns  as  fantastic  as  my   uncle  had   said but  not  so  mystifying   as  the  Pecos   diamonds.    At  first I figured  Indians   must   have  made   them   and   these  littlerodents  ran  off with  them.   But  why   would   an  Indian   spend his life doing   something    like  that?  On   our   way  back   to\nHereford    we  made   a  detour  to  see what   was   left,if anything,  of their  homestead.    The   shack   was  still there,  the color of rusted   machinery,    and  there  were  signs  that  some bums   or prospectors   had   lived in it.I didn't  see much    that sheep  could  have   grazed   on, but  along   the rimrock    of the\nPecos  River  we   found  a  lot of holes  made   by  rodents,  and some   with   these   little rocks  around    them.    They    were similar,  but whoever    made   them   got  tired and   quit before they  were    finished,   leaving   only  one   end   of  the  rock pointed.  It wasn't   like a  smart  Indian   to start  something, and  work   hard  at  it,then  leave  itunfinished.\n   In  an  alley  in  Clovis\u2014I     forget  why    I was   there\u2014 stepped   on  a nail  that went   right  through   the  sole  of my shoe.  Agnes   had   never  shown    any  interest  in  me  until  I stepped  on  that  nail. Back   in Hereford    the  first thing  she did was   heat  a kettle  of water   for me   to soak  my   foot in.\nUntil  the   soreness   was   gone   she  didn't  think   I  should work   all day  on  the tractor,  and   I agreed.  Actually,   until we  took  the  trip, I  had  more   or  less forgotten   how   close we  were   to the  desert.  The    one  thing  you   could   say for sure  about   a desert  was   that  it seldom   rained.   The   idea that it wasn't   going  to rain  in  Hereford    proved   to be  one that  I couldn't  get  rid  of. The   more   I looked   around,   in every  direction,  the  drier  it looked.  What    was   I doing?   I was  working    like  a horse   for thirty  dollars  a  month    and board  that  was  giving  me   the hives.  That   was  what   Agnes told me  when    I began   to scratch.  Hives   came   from   eating nothing   much   but  eggs  fried  in pork   fat, and  biscuits.\n   My   uncle  got  his  pork  and   fat from   a family   eighteen miles  to the  east that  raised  hogs  and   horses.  Their   name was  Gudger.    The    big house   they   lived in  and   the barns around   it had   once   been  part   of a  ranch,   but  the  overgrazed   land  was   no longer   useful  to  cattle. From   four  or five miles  away    I could   see the  branches    of  a dead   tree, the  bleached   color   of bones,   sticking  up   from   the  plain like  antlers.  There    wasn't    a  leaf  on  it, the  bark   was peeled   off, and   the house    and  the  barns   were   the  same weathered    color. The   Gudger    business   in horses   had  fallen  off, but   they  hobbled    the  few   they  had   left and   let them   wander    around.   There   were   kids  in the  yard   when we  drove   up,  the smaller   ones  with   hair  that  made   them look  like goblins.  They   were   busy   carrying  buckets   of hot water   to a mound    in the  yard,  under   a branch   of the  tree.\nIn  the   mound    was   a  big   wooden    vat,  wide    and   deep enough    to dip  a hog   into. The   hog   my   uncle  had  agreed to buy   a part  of was   in a  fenced-in   area  beside  the  barn.\nHe   was   so  big   that  from   the  rear   he  looked    like the mound    of  earth  over  a storm   cave.  I had  to  stoop  over  to see his  feet, no  bigger  than   the  bungs   you   use  to plug  up a barrel.   I  couldn't   believe   that  anything     so  gross  had such   delicate  feet.  Set  into  his  huge    face,  like  buttons, were   his  little eyes   and   long   silvery  lashes.   He   didn't mind   at all my   patting   his back   like the  rump   of  a horse.\n   On   our  ride  to the  Gudgers'    I  had  sat  in the  car  with\nDwight's    Winchester      rifle  across  my    lap.  On   windless days  I might   take  italong   on  the tractor  and   take  potshots at a  few  rabbits.  In  a  landscape    so big  and   empty   it was hard  to judge   how   far  away   I was  from   a rabbit.  My    rifle bullets  would    kick   up   the  dirt  maybe    twenty    yards   in front of them.   I could   see the  arc of  the bullet  as  itleft the barrel.  The    older,  smarter    jacks  would    hop   off  a  little ways,  then   situp   like penguins    and  watch    me.  So  far as  I know,   I never   hit one  of  them.\n   Dwight    had   explained    to me   how   to  shoot  a  hog.  You take  an  ear  of  corn,  with  the  tassels  still on  it, and  stick the smaller   end   in your   open   fly. The   hog  either  sees  the ear  of  corn  or  he   sniffs  it, and   comes   slowly   waddling toward   you.   When     he's  about   a  gun-barrel    length   away you  aim   right  between    his eyes  and   pull the  trigger.  He's so  surprised,   he   doesn't   know    what   hit  him.   The    only thing  that's  changed     is the  little black   hole  between    his eyes.  He   might   just  stand   there,   propped    like  a  barrel, until  you   take  a  fence   post  and   tilt him   over.  It  might take  two  or three   people  to budge    him.  Then    the one  with the  butcher   knife  slits his throat   and  catches   the  blood   in the  pan   while   his  heart   is still pumping.     It's the  blood that  makes   the  best  sausage   anybody    ever  ate.\n\n   It never  crossed   my   mind,   listening  to what   he  told  me, that  I would   be  the  one  to  shoot  the  hog.  I walked    along beside  him   to the  split  rail fence,  where    he  reached   into the pen  for  a tasseled  ear  of corn.  \"Here   you   are, kid,\"  he said, handing    it to me,  then  he  held  the  gun  while   I loosened  the  buttons   and  stuck   itin  my   fly. I didn't  have  the time  to  think  as  to whether     I wanted    to  do  it,before   it was  done.   I climbed   over  the  fence  about   ten yards   to his left,and   Dwight    handed   me   the rifle, after  he'd cocked   it.\nThere   was  just the  three  of us,  my  Uncle   Dwight,    me  and the  hog.   The   hog   lumbered      toward    me,  just   the  way\nDwight    had  said,  then  he stopped    and  raised  his big  head to look  at  the  corn.  I  had   never  before   been   so close  to anything   so  big. I  could  see  the  long  silvery  lashes  to his eyes.  He   wasn't    fierce  at  all, just  huge,   making     little grunts  like  a sow   with   a litter, his  ears  alone  so  big and furry  they  didn't  look  real. He   gave  me  all the  time  in the world   to  aim,   and   he   came    in  so  close  I  could   have reached   out  and   touched    him.   Right   between    his eyes   I saw  the   hole  I  had  made,    but   I hadn't   heard   a  sound.\nThe   two   of  us  just  stood   there  facing   each   other,  like\nDwight     had   in  mind   taking    our  picture,   only   he  was quick  to  scramble    over  the  fence   and  slide  a  post  under the  hog's  belly.  When    he  felt that  post  give  him   a  prod, he  spread   his  legs a  littlebit,  which   propped    him   like  a barrel.  Dwight    yelled  at me  to give  him   a hand,   and  I put down    the  gun   and   tried   to help   him.   The    hog   didn't budge.   Three   or  four  of the  kids who   had   heard   the gunshot  scrambled    over  the fence  and   helped   us push   on  him.\nWe   managed     to  rock  him   over,  and   with  his  feet  in the air he  gave  a mighty    shudder,   stiffening  his  legs. The   rest of it went  just  the way   Dwight    had   described   it,the  blood pumping     from   his  throat  as  black  as  oil, and   before  the gate to the  fence  was  lowered    Mr.   Gudger    was  there  with a team  of  horses.  It took  some  hauling   to  drag  him  over  to the tree,  get  the  rope  through    the  pulley   and   truss  him up.  Trussed    up   like  that,  hung   out  his  full  length,   he looked   more   like an  ox  than   a  hog.  The   idea  was   to let him  soak   for a bit in  the hot  water,   then  hoist  him  out  so all the little Gudgers    could  scrape   at his  hide  with  knives and  pieces   of broken    glass. They    were   expert   at it, and with  the  bristles shaved   off he  was   almost   pink.  The   first part  of him   to go  was  the  head,  which    they  propped    in a big bucket,   and  in  no  more   time  than   ittook   me  to blink itwas   covered   with  flies. Every   time  something     was  added to  the  pail the  flies rose  in  a cloud,  buzzing    like hornets. The   smell   of the  wet  hog,  the  sight  of the  steaming guts, the  way   the flies rose  up  in a cloud,  then   settled, led me  to  sort of  stand   off to one   side  watching,    but  I soon felt so  woozy    I  had   to  lean  on   the  car.  Every    time  I looked  at  the hog  he  was   smaller,  as  Mr.  Gudger     and  my uncle  hacked   away   at  him.  Soon   there  was   nothing   much but  just  the  huge   pair   of  hams,   turning    slowly   as  the wind   blew  on  them,  the  whole   pack   of littleGudgers    running  beneath   like  yapping    dogs.\n   We   were  all called  to the  house   by  Mrs.   Gudger    to eat the  pies she  had   baked,   and  drink   coffee. There    were   no rugs  in the  house,  just the  plank   floor that  the dust  puffed through    when   the   wind   blew.   We   sat  at a  table  in  the kitchen,   and  when    I raised   my   eyes  I could   see  the  sky through   the  chinks   in the  shingles.  It rained   so little they didn't  have  to worry   about   it raining  inside.  If I had   seen that   when    I  first  arrived    I  might    have   had   second thoughts    about  working     for my   uncle,  but   I would    have missed   seeing  the  Carlsbad    Caverns,   the  Pecos   diamonds, and  the  hog   I shot  with   my   uncle  watching.    I liked  that most  of  all,since  he  would   have   liked nothing    better than to see  me  miss.\n   Mrs.    Gudger,     a  worn,   stooped    old   woman     with   a flour-white    face,  but  her  hair   black  as  a  stove  lid, gave me  a  piece  of her  pie  to take  along   with  me,   I liked  itso much.   She   did the  baking,   but  her  oldest daughter,    Georgia,  did  the  cooking.   Georgia    wore   a  short-sleeved   shirt and  a pair  of khaki   work   pants  with   the legs  cut off at the knees.  She  had   taffy-colored   hair,  like her  brothers,  and  a light  brown    tan  all over.   Dwight    caught    me   looking   at her.  But   who   wouldn't    look  at  a girl  as  old  as she  was wearing    knee  pants   instead  of  a skirt?  From    the way   she liked  to  ride  horses,  bareback,    she  had   a  shine  between her  legs, like leather,   and  I had   seen  so many    girls in the last few  months    I was   glad  I didn't  have   to choose  one   of them.\n\nAs  the boy  had   never  looked  upon   the  sea, nor  any  body   of water   he  couldn't  see  over,  he  had  no  word   for  the landscape  that  he faced.   The  land   itselfseemed    to roll like the floors in amusement      parks.  Without    seeming   to climb   they would    be  on  a  rise  with  the  earth   gliding   away    before them,   and  in thefaraway     hollow   there  were   towns  a  day's ride  away.   The   wheels   turned,   the  earth  seemed    to flow beneath    the  buggy,    like  dirty   water,   but  nothing    else changed    and   they  seemed    to be  standing    still.Here   and there   white-faced    cattle,  known     as  Herefords,    stood  in rows   along  the  barbed  wire  fence  as  ifthey  had  never   seen a  buggy,  a  horse, or  a small  boy  before.  They   were   always stillthere,  as if painted   on  the fence   when    he turned   and looked.  Then    the road   itselfcame    to an  end  and   they  followed   the wavering     lines in  the grass  that  the  wheels   had made   the  week   before,  on  their  way   out.  And   when    they came   within   sight  of the  farm\u2014it     seemed    to recede,  and they seemed    to stalk it\u2014the    boy  knew   that  he was   nearing the rim   of the  world.   What   would   he  see  when   he  peered over  it?  The  hog.   The   hog  would    prove   to be  part  of  it.\nBut  the  bleak  house,   with  the  boarded    windows,    was   like a caboose   lefton  a siding,  and   behind   this house   the world seemed    to end.  In   the yard   was   a  tree,  but  it would   be wrong   to say  that  the  house  and   the tree  stood  on  the sky, or  that  the  body   of the   hog,  small   as  it appeared,    was dwarfed    by  it.It  swung'from      the  tree  like some   strange belliedfruit.  Swarming      about   in the  yard  were   large  boys with   knives,  sharpened     pieces   of metal,   and   small   boys with  long   spears   of broken    glass.  They    all attacked   the hog,  hooting   like Indians,   and   used  whatever    they  had   in hand   toshave   the stiff red  bristlesfrom   the  hog's hide.  The boy  could  see a small   hole, like a  third  eye, in the  center  of the  hog's   dripping    head.   The    mouth    was   curved    in  a smile  as  if the  swarm     of boys   scraping    his  hide  tickled him.  . ..From    one  of  the blood-smeared     pails  in  the  yard a black   cloud  offlies  rose  into  the air,  then  settled  again.\nThey   made    a sound    as if the  roaring   wind    had  been   siphoned    into a  bottle, leaving   the yard   empty   and   the flies trapped   inside  . ..pelting    the sides  like  a  quick  summer rain*\n\n   By  the  firstweek   of  April  it stillhadn't   rained.  I began to think,  while   I was   on  the  tractor,  how   great   itwas   in\n\n   \"The   RitesofSpring,\" 1952.\n\nApril  in  Lincoln   Park,   with   the grass   greening   and   the trees leafing.  Along   with  everything    else I liked,  itwould rain. Even   on  Larrabee    Street  I  liked the  way   it smelled after a rain.  Some   of these  days  I could   see it was  raining somewhere,    but   Texas   was  just  too  big  for it to  rain  all over.  That    would    be   true   with   or  without    Georgia\nGudger.   Another    problem    was   that  she didn't  know    better, and  I did.\n  With    allday  on  the  tractor  to think  about  the  future,  it seemed   drier  and  drier  to me  in the  present.  All  the money I  would   get,  if and   when   it rained,   seemed    to mean less to  me   than   a  week    or  two   in  Chicago     with   my friends. It would    take  me  that  long  to tell them  about   my adventures,    ana   my   plan   to  go  to  Pomona     College.   I hoped   to  persuade    Maurie     Johnson,    whose    father  had sold his  dairy  to Bordens,   to go  along  with   me.  He  would have  the  money.    His  father   had  bought    an  interest  in a\nNorth   Side  bank.  I had   allbut  forgotten   that Maurie    had told me   I might   get  a job  in  the  bank   over  the  summer.\nWorking    in a  bank   appealed   to me   more   than  a ten-hour day  on  a tractor.\n  The    thinking   I did   about   the  future  led  my   mind   to wander   while   I was  on  the  tractor.  I got the  plows   out of line, and  trying  to get  them   straight, one  of  them  jammed in the sod  and   stalled the  engine.  I knew   my   uncle  would soon  miss  the racket  of the  tractor,  and  itmade    me  a little frantic. I just  about  skinned    my  palms    trying  to spin  the flywheel,   but  she  wouldn't    catch.   When     I looked   back toward   the  house  there  was   Dwight,    with  the  dog, Jesus, coming   toward   me.  To  be  caught   like that  and  humiliated was  one  of  the worst   things  that  had   happened    to me.   It seemed   forever  before  he  reached   me,  the  dog  running    on ahead  to  scare up  rabbits,  and  I could   see the  way  he  was cursing  from   the way   his  head  pumped,    like  he was   gagging. I would   have  heard   it allbefore,  but  I had  no  choice but to listen  to it.But  what   I also  needed   the most  at that moment    was  an  excuse   to quit, and  he  had  given  it to me.\nWhile   he had   his back  to me,  wrestling   with  the  flywheel,\n\nIjust  walked   off. It was  such  a  big and   risky decision   my throat  ached,   and   I almost   bawled.    I'd gone   about   two hundred    yards  before   he  yelled  at me,   but  I didn't  look back.  He   called  my  name\u2014\"Wright!\"         he  hollered.  \"Oh,\n\nWright!\"\u2014which        was   almost   as  strange  as  hearing    my father  call me  \"son,\"  and   filled my  eyes  with  tears.  I had my   fists doubled   up   so hard   my   fingers   hurt.  Before   I reached   the house   he  had  the  tractor  started  and   I could hear  the  cough   blowing    on  the  wind,   but  he  stayed  out there,  plowing   up   the  section,  and  was   out  of  my   sight when   I glanced   back.\n  Agnes    was   hanging    out  her   wash   at  the  side  of the house   while   I packed    my   bag.  I  would    have  taken   off with  it, and  headed    for Hereford,    but  the  only  money    I had  was  what   Dwight    owed   me.   Having   to drive  me   into\nHereford   would    be another   thing  he  had  against   me.  Agnes  didn't   question   me   as  to  what    had   happened,     or where   it was   I  thought   I  was   going,  and   toward   three o'clock, because    he was   getting  hungry,    Dwight    came   in with  the  tractor.  When    he  saw   my  packed    bag  he  knew what   I was  up   to. He  had   to get  back  at me,   so he  said,\n\"If you're   dam-fool   enough    to  throw   away   ten thousand dollars  it'sbetter  I know   it now   than  later.\"\n   First of  all, it was  more    like seven  thousand,    and  the problem    was   that   I wasn't    dam-fool    enough.     In just walking   out  on him   the  way  I was   doing  I had   an advantage that  he  didn't  know    how   to handle.   He  changed    his clothes, which    was  a  lot of trouble,  just  to drive  me   into\nHereford.    There   was   a  train  at  five o'clock  that  would take me   to Amarillo,   where    I would   catch  the  night  train to Chicago.   He   gave  me   forty  dollars  cash,  which   would cover  my  fare, then   a twenty-dollar    check  on  an  Amarillo bank   I figured   might   bounce.    The   only   checks   I knew about,  my    father's, weren't    worth   the  paper   they   were written  on.\n   We   got to  Hereford    about  two   hours   too early,  where my  uncle   worked   up  a  great  story  as to how   I was   called back  to Chicago    on  an emergency.     It was  not  unusual   for something    to  get to  me,  like  the  problems    I  got into  at\n\nPacific  Union    College,   but   I knew    it was   unusual    for something    like me   to  get to  my   Uncle   Dwight.    Because his pride  was   bigger  than   mine,   ithurt   him  worse.   Mad as it made   him,   I could  also  see that  it had  increased   his respect  for me.  The   look  he gave  me   was  that  he knew   we were  one  of a  kind. We   just sat  there  in the store, our  feet on  the stoveboard,    sharing  the  package    of gingersnaps    he had  bought   me,   and  by  the time   the local  train had   come over  from  Clovis  things   were  pretty  normal    between   us.  I really liked  him,   as big  a fool as  I thought   him   to be.",

    "full_text": "As I rode  north   on  the Clark   streetcar  from   the  Loop,\nJv    I could   look  up  ahead   to the green   of Lincoln   Park, or down    the  narrow   streets  to the  east  to the  trees along the bridle   path  and  the  lake  and   the  sky  like the  rim  of the world.   I didn't like  everything   I saw,  but  itwas   home.\nMy   father   was  still in bed,  a  can  of  Carnation    milk   on the  windowsill,   with   green   around   the  holes  punched    in the can.  In  the warm    spring   drizzle  I walked   over  to Ogden  Avenue,    and  south   to  the  Larrabee    Y.  They   had   a stocky  ex-wrestler    working    in the  lobby   with  a  bandage on  his forehead    where   someone     had  hit  him  with   a  cue ball. The   stairs  to the  locker  room   still had  the  smell  of pool  chlorine,   but  the  locker   room   itself had   the  sweet smell   of  cheap   perfume.     That's    how   fast  things   can change   when   your   back  is turned.\n\n  I took  a  room   at the  back  of the  Y, where    I could  hear the balls  bounce,    then  I  looked   up  my   old  high   school friends  and  told  them   all about   Texas   and  Pomona     College.  What    I  found   was   that   you  can't   explain   some things  to people   who   have  always   lived in  Chicago.   They all had  families  to  tiethem   down,    and  I didn't.  They   all knew   what  they  were   going  to do, and   I didn't. On   Saturday  nights,  after we   had  been   to a  movie,  I might   spend the  night  with   Maurie     Johnson    or  Bill  Miller.   There were  eight  people   in  the  Miller  family   so  itwas   easy  to make   room    for me   at  their  table. In  the  last  few  years\nMrs.   Miller   had  grown    so large  a  place  had  been   made for her  in  the basement,    off the  kitchen,   so she  wouldn't have  to use  the  stairs. Mr.   Miller  had   bought   a Hupmobile sedan,   which   he  paid  us  fifty cents  an  hour  to  wax.\nOn   Sundays    he parked    it in the  front  yard  so  the  water he  used  to wash   itwouldn't    be  wasted.\n   Across  the  street from   the  Millers   the older  Baker   girl had   a  boyfriend    who    went   to  Northwestern.      On    the weekends    they   would   sit in  his  Scripps   Booth   roadster, the  red  and  green   gems   glowing    in the  dashboard    light.\nThe   Baker    girl  had   a  younger    sister,  Lois,  who    first had  to  help  her  mother   with   the  dishes  before  she  could come   out  and  sit on  the  porch   steps,  hugging   her  knees.\nHer   father  sat there   after supper   in  his B.V.D.'s,   hosing the  trees  so the  water   would    drip  on  the  grass  and   the walk.   If  her  sister's boyfriend    didn't   come   down    from\nNorthwestern,      she  might    ask  us   all over   to stir  some fudge   or  sing  along   with  her   at the  piano.   We   harmonized  pretty  good   \"How    Deep   Is the  Ocean,\"   \"Button    up\nYour   Overcoat\"    and   \"Little  White    Lies.\"  The    one  that suited  my  voice  the  best was   \"Little  White    Lies.\"\n   Lois  wasn't   old enough    as  yet  to have  real  boyfriends, bi^tnot  many    of the  boys  knew   it. With   her  long  flat feet in tennis  sneakers,   she  was   stillabout   half  an  inch  taller than  I was.   Her   favorite  color  at the  time   was  sky-bluepink.  Since  she  was  not  yet in her  first year  of high  school she  didn't  have   the  interest  in  college  that  I did.  I  was able to  help  her  with  her  charcoal   drawing    and  the  problems  she  was  having   raising   Belgian   hares.  Some   of them were   mean.   The    male   Belgian   hare   would    eat his  own litterif you  didn't  watch    him.  Lois  would    sitwith   one  of the big  ones  in  her  lap while   I told  her  about   butchering the hog   in Texas,   or  the  flood  I escaped   from   in  Mississippi.  Almost    anything    I said  made    her   laugh   like  she was   being  tickled.  The    way   I  stared  at  her  night   after night,  it'shard   to explain   why    what   I see  the  clearest  is the back   of her  neck.  The   barber   she went   to always   used the  clippers,  which    was  one   thing  that   drove  her  crazy.\nShe  looked    forward    to wearing    her   hair  in  braids   that hung   down   to  her waist.\n   Mrs.   Baker    welcomed     my   help   with  the   dishes,  and might   invite  me  to  go to  a  movie   with  them.   I was   with\nLois,  sitting down    near  the  front, when   we   saw  All  Quiet on  the  Western    Front,  and   she  almost   died.  Mrs.   Baker liked  me,  and  it worried   her  to think  what   Lois  would    do while   I was  off in  California.   Already   the  boys   her older sister  brought   home    asked   for  Lois   the  next   time  they called. She   was  only  fourteen,   but none   of them   seemed   to mind.   If I planned   to spend   four  years  in California,   with just June,   July  and  August    in Chicago,   Mrs.   Baker   could feel in her  bones   that we   were  all in for  a lot of surprises.\n\n  After   my  work   at the  Y,  I would   take  the streetcar  and ride the  thirty  minutes   north   to the  Baker   house.   If Lois wasn't  in the  hammock     on  the  porch,  she  would   be  in her room  at  the back  of  the house,   listening  to Wayne    King  at the Aragon.    I would   come    in from   the alley,  passing   her hutch   of  Belgian     hares,   and   climb   the   posts   of  the screened-in   porch   to the  roof. The    screen  to her  window was  unlatched,    and  I  could  either  crawl   in  or she  could crawl  out   and   sit there  with   me.   Right   down    the  hall were  her  two   bratty  little brothers,   with  her  older   sister right  next  to  the bathroom.     For  an  older   sister she  was exceptionally    broad-minded.      Mr.   and   Mrs.    Baker   had the  bedroom    at  the  front  where    I could   often  hear   the radio  playing.   I could   tell from   the  glances  Mrs.    Baker often gave  me   that she  knew   pretty  well  what   we  were   up to.At  the  time  I was   less informed    than  she  was.  Until  I got  to college,   and   read   about   it somewhere,      I  didn't know   that  what   we  had  been   up  to was   \"bundling.\"    The early  settlers used   to do  it. Not   knowing    what   it was,   I didn't  enjoy  it as much    as  I might   have.  Mrs.   Baker   believed  that  there  was   nothing    in  the  world   Lois   would remember     longer  than  what   she  was   now   doing  and   feeling. Lois   about   died  every  time   she  heard   that,  but  she believed  it was  the  truth.\n   The   friend  I talked   to the  most,  besides   Lois  and   her mother,   was   a boy  at  the Y   named    Laurie   Lusk.   Laurie played  right  tackle  for  Lane   Tech,   and  he  was  interested in going   on  to college.  On   his graduation    his  father  gave him   a Model    A   Ford   touring,   with  yellow   wire   wheels and  a  new   set of Kelly   Springfield   tires. It was   Laurie's idea, as  much    as it was   mine,   that we   would   drive  it all the  way   to  California,   the  two   of us  camping     out  and sharing   the  expenses.    Yet   if I  hadn't   talked   so  much about  Pomona     College,   and  what   the  winter   was  like  in\nCalifornia,   I  might   have  found    some   excuse   to  stay  in\nChicago   rather   than   say  goodbye    to Lois   Baker,   which took  me  almost  a  week.\n  And   yet  I hardly  remember     our  actually  leaving.  It was\nMrs.   Baker   who   did  most  of the  crying,  with   Lois'  little brother   Charlie   being   the  biggest  nuisance.    I don't   remember    how   itwas   with  Maurie    Johnson,   or  Bill Miller, or all my  friends  at the  Y,  or what   I said to my   father,  or he said  to me.  I  was  so anxious    to get away   before  something  went  wrong    I didn't  write  my   Aunt   Winona     about it,fearing  that  might   jinx it, and  I forgot  the  racing  goggles I had   bought   for  driving   in the  sun  and   wind   with the top  down.   I don't  remember     the  route  we  took  out  of\nChicago,   or where   it was  we  crossed  the  Mississippi,   or if we  stopped,   as  we   had   planned,   in  Shenandoah,      Iowa, where   Shelley   had  gone   and  learned   to  play  horseshoes, but we   did get  eaten  up  by  mosquitoes    the night  we   slept in the car  near  Des   Moines.\n  In  Omaha     the  grass  was  all chewed    up  in front  of the\nMulligan    house.   Mr.   Mulligan    was   asleep,  stillbeing   a pressman,    and    Mrs.   Mulligan     didn't   feel  she  should wake   him,   but  she  telephoned    Joey   at the  Daily   News, where   he  worked    in  the  pressroom    during   the  daytime.\nHe  got  excited  when   he  saw   me, just  the  way  he  used  to, his scalp   glowing   pink   beneath    his  short  blond   hair.  I could  tell he  resented   the  idea  of Laurie    now   being  my best friend.   It was  hard   for  us to  talk, with   the  presses running,   but  I learned   he had   played  football  for Omaha\n\nTech   and   he  was   now   engaged    to  Lillian   Kovack,   the pretty  Polish  girl whose   hand   I had  held  in  the basement of the house   when   we  played   \"Run   Sheep   Run.\"   She  had changed   so much    he  wasn't  sure  at  all I would   recognize her, and  worked    as  a clerk  in McCrory's     dime   store. He didn't  understand    anybody     as  old  and   smart   as  I was wanting   to  go  to school   instead   of working    and   getting married,   especially  so far  away.\n\n   If we   went  through    my   hometown      in Nebraska,     and we  pretty  well  had  to, since  it was  on  the  Lincoln   Highway,   I don't   remember     anything    about   it. I may    have been   dozing   while   Laurie   was   driving,   or  I may    have been  thinking   of  California,   or  of college,  or of  making up  my  mind   if we  should   head   for Texas,  just  to see if it had   rained   on  my   uncle's   farm   near   Hereford,    or  go straight  through   to  Salt  Lake   via  Wyoming,     which   was what  we   did. I don't  remember    too  much   about   Salt Lake\nCity  either, except   for the mountain     water  running   along in the  ditches,  but  somewhere     along   the  way   we  did  let the  top   down    and   were   soon    sunburned     so  bad   we couldn't  sleep.  I do remember     Needles,   which   was   hot as fire,and   I wanted    to look  around   for  the Big  Six  Studebaker   my   father  and   me   and   Don   had   left in  a  place called Siberia,  but  they  had  improved    the road   across that part  of the  desert  and  places  like  Siberia  were   no  longer on  it.\n   Nor  was   California,  in September,    much    like the way   I had  described   itto Laurie,   the glare  of light  off the desert so strong  we   had  to  squint  to see  the hazy   mountains.    It wasn't  the  time  for oranges,   but  in the  shade   of the  trees we  could   see the  way   the  groves  swept   back  to  the  foot-\n\n      \u2014 hills, which    would    be  mountains     back   where    we   had come  from.   I was  looking   up  ahead  so  hard  for the  college that we   drove  right  by  it,and   had  to come   back.   On  one side was   the  desert,  the  air  like ripples   in glass,  except where   they  had  sprinklers   running    on  a golf  course,  and on the  other  this  dark  green   oasis. I wanted    to arrive  the way   I had   the   first time,  coming     up  from   the   Pacific\nElectric  station  with  the  eucalyptus    trees framing    a view of the mountains.    On   the  campus    they  had  the  sprinklers running,   and  at  that  time  in  the morning,    with   the  mist rising, it was  like a  Maxfield    Parrish  painting.   We   didn't see any   students,   just  the  ivy  on  the  buildings   and   the blackbirds   with   their  hatpin   eyes.   We   drove   up  to  the foothills just to look  back  at  it,then  we  came   back  slow  to where   we   could  read   what   was   engraved    on  the  college gates   incipit   vita  nova\u2014which        I explained    to  Laurie meant   \"Here    begins   a  new   life.\" That    was   how   I  felt about  it,and   I had  come   to believe, thanks   to some   people\n\nI had   met,   that  what    you   feel strongly    enough    about might   happen.   I was   twenty   years  of  age,  and  my   Uncle\nDwight    would   say  itwas   about  time.",
